This has been going on for months as I have contacted my HOA (Waterways) and Pulte to have this road watered to no avail. This is causing breathing issues due to the massive amount of unknown partials that I am breathing daily. I am retired and work outside in my yard and continue to breath this unknown substance. This is a blatant disregard for my health/property, wife's health/property along with the other 14 homes along this dirt road - and is a direct violation. I have videos of the massive clouds of partials created by each truck up and down Belvedere Rd. Due to the size restrictions of your site I am unable to send you the videos but are available at anytime. I have added a picture as of yesterday on the grit that is generated and hangs in the air with each truck that passes Monday-Friday 8-5. It is ruining my outdoor furniture not to mention what I am breathing (picture of where I ran a cloth over a piece of plastic from one day) as I have to cover it in plastic front and back porches all week and cannot sit outside and enjoy it or grill out. I need something done ASAP and if I have contacted the wrong parties please refer me accordingly.

        "complaint": "egregious development by TPA Residential .  I have been living adjacent to a nightmarish and non stop assault on my quality of life for 15 months  and NOW?  It's even worse and STILL no end in sight. Originally, when they publicized the plans they claimed the entire project including vertical buildings would be finished by June of '24.  They won't even be finished with the mitigation by then.  \r\nThey are taking absolutely NO care to keep the toxic dust and dirt out of the air and it is floating around the area coating everything, including my home and car.  When I approached the site manager the other day and asked instead of crushing the old concrete slabs through a grinder making horrible noise and spewing toxins into the air why don't they haul it all out and crush it in a waste disposal area,  he denied it was happening, said \"It's too expensive\" So in other words, we are creating a  high decibel, highly stressful atmosphere and spewing toxins  all over  a residential area and then  dismissed me, told me to get off the property and that he would not discuss it.  \r\nI have not been able to use my property during the day outside since August of '22 due to the noise, stench and toxic nature of the site where old homes full of asbestos and lead paint and cars and who knows what else was dumped there.  I can literally feel grit and dirt on my face if I have to go out in my yard for any reason.  And it still stinks out there at night most of the time. \r\nI probably have the worst of it, given that my property is on the corner closest to the operation with both front and back yards facing it, but it's affecting people across, along both sides of the block.  \r\nIt's become inhumane and abusive and made my lovely home a hell hole.  And TPA does not care whatsoever.  They lied from the beginning about the scope of this project to keep people from standing up against it. Either that or they are catastrophically incompetent, which is as bad.  And NOT ONE TIME, has ANYONE offered me ANY compensation for the LOSS of the use of my property, for the stress, for the dirt and dust all over my pergola, my porch, my outdoor furniture, my care. EVERY SINGLE DAY. \r\n\r\nThey sent these smiling young representatives over in the early summer of 2020\r\n\r\nto show us all the wonderful plans for the location and said NOTHING about the mitigation, although I knew from a neighbor that there would be some.  And when they did get it started and it was evident that this was really bad, they lied about how long it would go on. John Jensen, The project manager said to my face that it would be completed no later than March of '23, which in October of '22 when he said it, sounded horrible. 5 more MONTHS of this?!!! That's a dream now. \r\n\r\nThis disgusting glossing over of it that everyone's values will increase because of it while they are destroying our rights to some quality of life for YEARS, is no comfort.  I would GLADLY give that up to have avoided this monstrous and corrupt profiteering at the expense of the surrounding community.  \r\nHere are some photos and videos to support that they are unleashing toxic dust all over everyone. Enjoy the rattling, roaring, banging, clanging, beeping.  The windshield is my car the day after I washed it. That's what it's like almost every day.\r\nIMAGINE LIVING WITH THIS 6 DAYS A WEEK ALL DAY FOR 2 YEARS.  THEN IT WILL BE AT LEAST  ANOTHER 1.5 YEARS OF VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION.  WHO APPROVED THIS?",

Mr. Baxter is raising over 10,000 quail for commercial sale in pens less than 300 feet from my residence. The dust from the birds (from their feed/bird feces) that the fans throw into the air, happens several times throughout each day. I am growing older and have major breathing problems and this irritates my respiratory system. The bird pens back up to the federally protected wetlands and the urine from the birds, dust from the birds when it rains, all runs off into the wetlands. I am concerned for that as well as the disposal of any deceased birds. Mr. Baxter did have an inspection from the state (Complaint Case Number: 89694338742) but told Robert Veal (state inspector # 260564) that he was not selling birds to the public so the property was not inspected for commercial sales.",

We noticed an unusual shape of the cloud over our home in Milledgeville GA and found that there's a massive cloud of hazardous air pollution coming out of Sparks, GA. Ive attached images of the phenomenon we noticed on the AQI radar map. A cursory search of plants in the Sparks area shows that there's a large BASF chemical plant there. We don't know what's producing the toxic cloud, but it's apparent that an emitter in Sparks is the culprit. Can someone investigate?",

        "complaint": "Follow up to above referenced complaint: CTS 102802\r\nIt is now several months since this initial complaint and as I suspected, the business is now once again exhausting fumes that have a very strong odor and are causing me to be nauseous in my own yard and home.  I would ask that you send a different investigator who will actually perform a thorough investigation on these toxic fumes. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe following is a draft of an email that I composed, but never sent with the hopeful expectation this matter was resolved. Clearly, it is not:\r\n\r\n    I would invite each of you to review the complaint, and the subsequent report/investigation of my complaint. It was my hope that you would find no toxic chemicals and put at ease my mind and concerns over what I and my neighbors are inhaling. \r\nAfter reviewing the report online, I spoke with Mr. Mark Peake this morning in regards to his investigation and report. Unfortunately, this did very little to ease my concerns. \r\n\r\nAs stated in the report and confirmed in our conversation this morning, he did no actual monitoring or testing of the emissions from the building. The fan was not running. Fumes were not being exhausted. He did not specify, approve or audit the source of the emissions.\r\n He did not physically inspect the chemicals being used. He conducted a cursory tour of the property and subsequently allowed the owners to self report on the amounts and types of chemicals being used. \r\nIn addition, he allowed them to self report on the data sheets and provide them to him in a delayed response a week or two later.\r\n In my opinion, this was little more than a telephone interview could have accomplished, not a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nAnd as of today, miraculously, the fan is once again running, and exhausting fumes, which have absolutely no odor at all.  Imagine that!\r\nI am certainly pleased to report that I am not inhaling nauseous fumes. However, I do not consider this matter closed, and I am highly concerned that it will continue once the owners believe they are no longer being monitored. \r\nIn addition, Mr. Peake found it necessary to reprimand me when I inquired as to a valid permit for this business. He stated the owners are not required to have a permit for any air quality emissions and the business was allowed there long before this residential neighborhood was built. I would invite him or you to verify those comments. My home was built in the 1930s. This neighborhood was platted and developed before that time and I know for a fact that business has not been operational for 90 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nI submitted a simple request to my government agency after speaking with the owner multiple times over the course of 5 years about the condition of the property, and he refused with a sly grin to participate in any type of voluntary cleanup.\r\n I have even suggested that a baffle be placed on the building to direct those fumes up rather than directly into my residence.\r\n I\u2019m not asking for his livelihood to be affected. I\u2019m asking for a simple, commonsense remedy so that we can all live without toxic air in our homes.\r\n",

Let me begin by saying that THE CLEAN AIR ACT protects health and welfare from different types of air pollution.  This mill is already not following the act and with growth and additions, it will comply even less.  Our property is approximately 300 yards from this saw mill and we deal with the air pollution daily!  There are many problems that already affect us daily with existing mill without the approval of additions that you seem to want to approve.  The noise level is already unbearable at most times and it has taken away all of our peace and tranquility.  We can not enjoy being at home for all the NOISE!  At the same time, we are dealing with fallout from the mill such as smoke/smog settling down on us and constant sour smells.  There is a loud humming noise from the pellet mill that has increased as well.  Also this year, we have an additional problem of wood chips (sawdust) falling on our property, particularly our vehicles.  They have been covered with this fallout and I have advised a lawyer in Swainsboro along with pictures as documentation.  Our car detailer has told us that this residue will damage the paint on our vehicles!!  Keep in mind that we are breathing all this stuff into our lungs and God only knows what it is doing to our health and breathing.  We have valid concerns already with existing problems, this expansion will add to the levels of gases and different chemicals being released into the air and providing even greater damage to our health.  I know that you state this will be monitored, but I think these reports should be published and mailed to neighbors of the mill.\r\n\r\nI also believe that a public hearing should be conducted to address the issues that are current and any issues the expansion may cause.  The method and frequency of monitoring should be discussed and any questions should be answered at this time.  The notice of public comment was hidden in our local paper in the middle of legal ads.  It should have been on a page in bold print so it was easily seen and should have been broadcast on our local radio station.  In addition, a personal letter should have been sent out to landowners within a 5-mile radius.  I strongly feel that I have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed.  It is my understanding that laws, rules and any government decisions should be fair to ALL people, not just one group pr entity.\r\n\r\nMs. Kirby has spoken with Richard MacNeely, a local lawyer in Swainsboro who represents Faircloth Forest Products, and has expressed her concerns to him several times. \r\n",

        "complaint": "We have a serious situation in Midtown with a construction site emitting large amounts of white plastic pellets from sanding of their high-rise insulation. It is blanketing the neighborhood, floating in the air, ending in pools, etc. The situation is awful. Please provide emergency intervention for this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks much for your help.\r\n\r\nThe building in question is the Toll Brothers (Balfour) Momentum Midtown towers between Spring and West Peachtree, at 1018 W. Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA 30309 (https://www.momentummidtown.com).\r\n\r\nThe white pellets from them sanding their building insulation without any protection are overwhelming the neighborhood. We have a lot of construction around us, but it has never reached a point where we cannot use the Aqua Condominium pool which is actually hidden from the construction by our building, but yet is filled with white pellets.\r\n\r\nThis is the building in question. It is the same building that had the collapsed crane. You can see the white Styrofoam insulation being applied and being sanded down generating showers of white particles in a half mile radius.\r\n\r\nCan you please help us by activating the appropriate enforcement unit of the city. We cannot have our pool disabled for the entire summer because of the careless construction practices of Balfour.\r\n\r\nThis is the worse construction pollution I have seen here in Midtown since 2017.\r\n\r\nThe construction is bringing with it challenges as we know, and I want to raise the issue of the amount of flying debris and small plastic particles coming from these construction sites.\r\n\r\nIn particular the building right across from us (the one where the crane lost its ballast recently) is being covered by a white plastic isolation material (Styrofoam or something similar) which after installation is sanded in a process which sends a rain of very little while pellets in a radius of probably a half a mile. Our building swimming pool which is actually on the back of Aqua has a large quantity of these pellets floating. This is concerning because of the amount of dirt generated in Midtown, but also because as we know these debris do not just disappear, they create a long lasting pollution and contribute to the awful microplastic pollution of our water systems and oceans.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is what can be done to force construction companies to reduce the amount of dust generated?

The Smell can be smelt all over East Dublin, Eastern Laurens County in the city and the county parts and sometimes as far as into Dublin.  It has particularly gotten worse over the past year and now is emitted on a daily basis. The air quality is so bad you can not open your windows or door nor sit outside without being overwhelmed with the disgusting smell, which sometimes will turn your stomach and about make you vomit it's so terrible. \r\nAt one point several years ago a lawsuit was brought against them and they were made to add a chemical to whatever it is they up there cooking/manufacturing, which would eliminate the odors. But after the New owners Darling took over they do not use the product and just pollute our air, it also keeps new businesses from coming to our area, and homeowners sell. It is ashamed you cannot sit outside in your yard or drive down the road towards town without being subject to this poor air quality. \r\nPlease respond with any information to help with this problem.

        "complaint": "Georgia DNR - EPD, \r\n \r\nI am a citizen of Henry County (Ellenwood 30294) who has a concern regarding air quality, as it pertains to foul odors.  I cannot perfectly describe the smell, but it reminds me of a surfer or rotten egg smell.  I have particularly noticed it around my home beginning a year or two ago (maybe longer), sometimes late night and mostly early morning.  The odor has become more prominent and more of a regular thing over the past several months or more.  I used to only notice it when I go outside of my house, but now it seeps indoors.  That is what I wake up to many mornings - that foul smell.  I step outside and there it is, but stronger.  It makes me nauseous.  I can\u2019t even sit on my screened porch and enjoy myself.  I am not sure where it is coming from, but I am very concerned with how this may impact my health, as well as my joy.  I have lived in my home for over 23 years now, and have only noticed this in the more recent year or two as a constant thin in the mornings more often than not.\r\n \r\nMany years ago, I lived in another area in Ellenwood that is in Dekalb County, where it was guaranteed daily either morning and/or evening to night that the odor would appear.  I complained then to no end and no satisfaction.  I suspected it was coming from a land field near I-285 on the East side near the 675 and Bouldercrest exits. Now years later and in another area, I am experiencing it again.\r\n \r\nI would like to get more information on: \r\nWhat the odor is, \r\nWhere it is coming from, \r\nWhat is the impact to health of residents, \r\nWhat can be done to eliminate it, and \r\nWho within the state and/or county is responsible for addressing this concern.\r\n \r\nI would very much appreciate a response.",

They said that they will never get caught and if they did it only be a fine which is less than paying to take it to a landfill. This property is R2 agricultural. Which does not allow this. They have put chairs and grills there to say they are having a bonfire. How to or can you bring a truck load of debris with their dump trucks and unload it and then call it a bonfire. They say that they are being tipped off by someone at the Carroll County zoning when someone is coming to the property. We went to court and was suppose to have another court date but it hasn\u2019t been done.",

In GA, for example, the limit is 15 minutes except when the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit when it is extended to 25 minutes\r\n\u2022\tRepeated violation of housekeeping standards by knocking down barriers and bunding required to keep loose dirt, wood debris from washing into the street and sewers, thereby creating blockage of sewer gray water exfiltration through the sewer system for proper treatment and disposal, notwithstanding the health issues created by this practice to all of us who live here\r\n\u2022\tRepeated neglect to enforce the general duty clause in the practice of hearing protection, noise mitigation, eye protection (ANSI Z-87.1) and other components of the General Duty Clause; in addition, this is a neighborhood with children, pedestrians and seniors, not a construction zone, yet heavy unloading repeatedly occurs with no ground flagman or other warning to our population (heavy equipment is repeatedly run up an down the street without signals or signalpersons on foot to assure safe transit (most certainly out of your purview, yet an associated concern.\r\n\r\nI know that our Owner\u2019s Association has sued Horton over similar violations while building in another part of our community without an obvious impact on their behavior and performance\r\n\r\nI should like to think you would be able to send one of your team to inspect this construction and determine whether or not this complaint(s) is/are valid. \r\n\r\nRespectully,\r\n\r\nJim Joyce (mobile: 508-xxx-xxxx)\r\n",

Also, Ms. Vaughn said Ms. Lauren McDaniel a representative from GEPD has visited the plant in the past regarding the air pollution, however, she is no longer with GEPD.  Ms. Vaughn said when she contacted GEPD's office recently she was advised to reach out to EPA due to understaffing issues.  You may reference the email below and the video from Ms. Vaughn with her contact information which she forwarded after my conversation with her.  If you are not the contact to respond, please forward this message.  Lastly, Ms. Vaughn said she wants this complaint on record with EPA.",

I found him as a point of contact, off the EPA website. It stated that there was private funded programs to allow citizens to utilize particulate matter testing for their area. I am requesting support to do this and requesting the EPA test the Meadowcreek high school property and adjacent neighborhoods in Norcross, Georgia. The site sits adjacent to the extremely large Vulcan quarry that has over 85 violations in multiple states across the country for high Particulate Matter output from Quarry operations. These operations can add to asthma and cancer levels and should immediately be tested on the Meadowcreek High School property. The Vulcan property has been only feet from Meadowcreek for almost 30 years and as far as I know,  has NEVER been tested for particulate matter levels in the air or pollution levels in the water that passes underneath the quarry and dumps into a small residential lake, while multiple athletic fields only feet from the site expose young athletes to potentially cancer causing high particulate matter only feet from Vulcan property. There are two High Schools one public, Meadowcreek HS, one private, Atlanta Christian, within one mile of the massive quarry. Can the EPA finally air quality test in this area for a 12 month period? How can a citizen request this Federal agency to finally test the silica level in the water directly across the street in the water downstream of this area? Too long this  location and placement of this high school has been unaddressed and its potential danger to student athletes and resident in the low income area? Please Advise.",

I have seen that the smoke is a product from land clearing. \r\n\r\nI am not wanting to make a fuss over land clearing, as it usually causes no interferences or any other issues, but this is affecting a whole community. \r\n\r\nThe smoke is so heavy and thick, that one can not even see any of the road when attempting their daily commute. It is suffocating to just walk outside, even as a healthy young adult. My one year old already has an major impact on his breathing due to the smoke pollution. I can barely see my driveway during the day. I have soot and black ashes in my nose, just from breathing the air in my yard. \r\n\r\nLocal authorities stopped traffic yesterday morning for a couple hours, due to the volume of the smoke and concern for safety. \r\n This was a major inconvenience to myself and anyone else who is on a timed schedule.

        "complaint": "Dear Mr. Williams,  \r\n\r\nI\u2019m contacting you in regulars to the fact there is ongoing grading in rural Rutledge Georgia as of this week billowing tons of red dust into the air. \r\n\r\nThere was a recent court ruling against the JDA and the State regarding a bond they were requesting for RIVIAN to be built here. The court ruled with the citizens and against the State and JDA. \r\n\r\nIn court, both the representative for the State and the JDA stated, without this bond, this project cannot go forward. \r\n\r\nWe in opposition, mainly because of the environmental issues that a 20 million sq ft MEGA Industrial Auto Plant, 7 stories high on 2003 acres in a RURAL agricultural zoned area, will cause irreparable damage to our community. \r\n\r\nThis grading, in spite of what both parties swore under oath to the judge about the bond denial \u201ckilling the deal\u201d, is a slap in the face of the court and the citizens here in opposition. \r\n\r\nWe are well dependent, this grading and the fact we are all well dependent here, is unacceptable! Water is already an issue here. My husband and I have in the past, had our own well go dry. We could not afford a drilled well so we had to pay for another dug well far from the dry well and the cost to run pipe back to our house, was as much or more than the well. \r\n\r\nOur Morgan County Comprehensive Use Plan, 2017-2036 states this land and all around it will remain agricultural through 2036. We citizens who live, work, farm, own small businesses here, are the ones who approved that plan. We depended on people, we had trusted to implement that plan through its full term and theirs, but they did not. \r\n\r\nThose on the JDA and Morgan County Board of Commissioners who were supposed to represent our area in this county, some developed their own legacy farmland (one, the former JDA chairman serving then, resigned, before he was paid a great profit, (20 times the going price per acre here) for that same legacy farmland, saying \u201cbecause it wouldn\u2019t look right if he was still chairman\u201d when his families good name and legacy farmland was sold out and paid for. (All public record) \r\n\r\nThe JDA threw this project to the state by letter overnight (again public record) when citizens were finally told RIVIAN was coming to Rutledge and it was already a \u201cDone Deal\u201d. There was no transparency! Everything done on this \u201cclosed door deal\u201d for years, had been hidden in secret, under NDAs. The first any citizen (not involved) knew about this, was when the Governor announced on TV Dec 16, 2021 that RIVIAN (the company the state had already purchased the Industrial site for, near Savannah) where they have placed Hyundai recently. Instead RIVIAN (a risky financial EV start up) would be put on our legacy farmland zoned Agricultural, being actively farmed (the last hay was just cut recently).  \r\n\r\nAfter the project was thrown to the state by the JDA, stating by letter \u201cthis project (they developed) is too big for us to handle, the Gov took it over for the State, the next day. \r\n\r\nThe rezoning meeting, our ONE chance to express our environmental and other concerns, was cancelled! And the rezoning from agricultural until 2036, now for heavy industrial use by the State, the sign came down. \r\n\r\nWe in Rutledge, with Hard Labor Creek State Park and UGA\u2019s Observatory placed here intentionally, because of lack of light pollution, will no longer be able to operate and use their brand new telescope. \r\n\r\nCamp Twin Lakes where I volunteer in summers as \u201cnurse Pam\u201d for our special needs children, is in sight of this area. It like the Observatory, was placed here for a reason. Clean air and clean well water. The twin lakes the special children fish in and row in, not to mention the peace and quiet a camp like this needs, will all be taken away. \r\n\r\nOur abundant wild life including the American Bald Eagle that soars overhead after making a comeback here, will all be in danger! The barn swallow nests are abundant here. They build every year on my front porch and in barns and at houses all around. Deer are plentiful here along with many other species. Squirrels, including black fox squirrels, birds of ever color, we have it all! For now. The Georgia Audubon Society was already aware of RIVIAN early on in this process and we\u2019re concerned about it\u2019s impact here.\r\n\r\nPlease, I beg you, if there is anything the State EPD and/or DNR can do to help us here and save our legacy farmland and wildlife habitat, it will be most appreciated. The DNR building and fish hatchery are in this same area of the proposed plant, on Hwy 278 in neighboring Walton Co. We never had a voice, because there was no transparency here and we didn\u2019t know anything of the magnitude of this plant, heading our way. Please be our voice now! \r\n\r\nI have a picture of the Bald Eagle in a tree on Centennial Road, taken recently by my husband\u2019s cousin. A road with no exit or entrance now, about to be changed. It\u2019s exit\u2019s and entrances will feed onto a five lane access Road, running adjacent to I 20. \r\n\r\nI have concerns about all these things and more. I have concerns about where all this displaced wildlife will go. I have concerns about our special kids at Camp Twin Lakes who just returned this year after missing two years of eligibility to this camp, because of the Pandemic. \r\n\r\nThat is their only time they are away from home, at no charge to their parents. A magical place where all their outdoor dreams can come true! A chance to spend a week with other children like themselves out of doors, with nature and do what other more able bodied children take for granted at summer camps. One on one ratio camper to counselor, volunteer nurses, firefighters, EMTS make this possible, along with our sponsors. \r\n\r\nDuring the past two years, with generous donations from sponsors, Camp Twin Lakes has doubled its size! Prepared to open the new section soon and serve twice as many special needs children as ever before. We celebrated our 30th year with MDA Camp there in July of this year. Please don\u2019t let it be our children's last! They have fragile conditions such as muscular dystrophy, diabetes, cancer, skin disease and so much more. They can\u2019t be exposed to contaminants in air and water, or the noise and light pollution. \r\n\r\nWhen we Rutledge citizens finally found out on TV RIVIAN was coming, we started attending as many JDA meetings as we could, trying to have an opportunity to express ALL our many concerns. \r\n\r\nAt one of those many meetings we attended early on, the JDAs own expert admitted our water table, the loss of multiple ponds on this land as well as our three best natural streams to be covered over with dirt and buried under 2003 acres of concrete and asphalt, would all be affected. Greatest fear, our wells! The expert also said lakes and streams from here at HLC State Park, Camp Twin Lakes next door, on down to Lake Sinclair and Lake Oconee would be adversely affected. We heard him! \r\n\r\nNo EPD studies have been shown to us. One meeting for citizen input on design and EPD issues, held in Monroe, Walton Co turned out to be only a \u201cflack taker\u201d meeting. The panel had no answers for our questions and concerns. No plan or designs to even show us for input on. No EPD studies had been done and no permits had been applied for. \r\n\r\nIt seems once the State of Georgia took over the project, our legacy farmland, the need for normal ways for citizens to have any input, checks and balances here on zoning and other issues, were all taken away. \r\n\r\nAfter our prescient setting win in court denying the bond came down, it now seems nothing has changed! With the drought we are experiencing no consideration for us in that. Grading was to start on this past Monday, and it did! The dust is rolling, smell of pine sap is in the air, the noise pollution has begun along with the destruction and the erasure of 2003 of the most beautiful \u201ctrue green\u201d legacy farmland acres in Georgia, has begun. \r\n\r\nPlease if you can\u2019t stop this, and we\u2019ve won what both parties said would \u201ckill the deal\u201d in court. Hiring the best EPD attorney we could find, recommended to me as one of five by our national EPD when contacted. We at the late notice we finally got, after the deal was done, have done everything agencies such as yours has recommended we do, but still the State started grading on their own previously set schedule? Again, as if we citizens and the courts and agencies that regulate these things, don\u2019t exist! \r\n\r\nCan our state run completely over our rights and grade our way of life away? No matter how this was achieved and no matter what the court rules against them? \r\n\r\nWe will lose all the green, all the trees, and all the wildlife habitat along with our only sources of clean water. We need that water for our wells we are dependent on here. Our pools that weren\u2019t closed yet, already have a layer of red dust and reddened debris in the bottom. Our air is dusty red. Our hearts are broken but not our spirits. \r\n\r\nRutledge isn\u2019t known as \u201cSmall But Special\u201d as just a slogan. We are special because of our community, our people and will remain so. A town with a population less than 1000 has opposition numbers 3400 strong on our #no2rivian website and Our Communities Oppose RIVIAN Assembly Plant page, on FB. Hundreds of the community filled a giant barn recently to hear from our lawyers, just before the ruling in our favor! \r\n\r\nIf you want to see what we have, please visit these sites online or better yet, come here in person. I\u2019d be happy to show you around! \r\n\r\nMy husband and I own the oldest business in town, Rutledge Hardware Store built in1891 and has been in continuous operation since. We are the fourth owners of record. We have fought for the best for this community, for 42 years. We got Rutledge, as a town, on the National Register of Historic Places. \r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t even have a red light in town, we have a STOP barrel that the NY Times featured and called \u201cRutledge\u2019s only sophisticated traffic device\u201d. It was built by my father in law and his good friend and sanctioned by the DOT as their engineers had no solution for where to put stop signs on our corners of Main and Fairplay street. \r\n\r\nRutledge Hardware sits on Fairplay Street. We live on Fairplay Road. This one move by local officials thrown to the State puts everything we have here in jeopardy. The JDA has a new sign at the exit off I 20 onto Hwy 278 on the Rutledge side. It stands exactly where I have a photo of my husbands grandmother Cassie tending her cows in 1930, on the historic Butler Place. Nothing done here by county or State, has been \u201cFair Play\u201d.\r\n\r\nThat new sign with the JDA on it and put up by them, reads \u201cEast Atlanta MEGA Industrial Site\u201d. There could not be a more unsuitable place or contrast between Grandma Cassie standing on that spot with her Jersey cows and now the JDA planting their sign there, announcing the plans they have for us. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but to me that is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. The JDA announcing they are not finished here, they\u2019ve only just begun. There will be no evidence of the generations of farmers who still farm here today. There will be no home for the Bald Eagle and the thousands of other wildlife that is so abundant here now. No barns for the barn swallows to build  nests in. There will be no gently rolling green pastures or farms or clean water or star lit nights here for our observatory. By erasing our history, they, the JDA are erasing our agricultural heritage, ALWAYS and forever.\r\n\r\nTheir excuse, to create more jobs. We need more workers here, not more jobs! We need real green pastures to lie down in, not a risky start up EV Auto Plant! Look at help wanted signs and unemployment rates for our county and state. Where will 7500 workers come from? Where will they live? There aren\u2019t locals available for these new jobs or even enough locals needing work for the two jobs for every unemployed worker here today!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry this letter is so long and got so personal. But I\u2019m laying my broken heart bare for you. I\u2019m doing this to see if anyone in this state truly cares about the environment that exists here now and the needs of citizens and Camp Twin Lakes for special children. The Observatory, the farms and the families who exist here now. I pray you do. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPam Jones, RN \r\nSmall business owner \r\nProtector of all things Rutledge for over 42 years   ",

For the last several months, there has been a pungent, nauseating odor coming from the Pilgrims Pride feed mill located on Tallassee Rd. here in Athens.  At times, it is so bad, we can\u2019t go outside.  We have had guests leave a get together at our home because they were becoming nauseous from the smell.  \r\nI have tried to contact the company but with no success.  I did reach a live person one time but they showed no interest in helping me or even talking about the situation.\r\nI have gone to the Pilgrims Pride website to look for a \u201ccontact us\u201d link but it seems one does not exist.\r\nI\u2019m running out of options here.  Is there something that can be done?  Can someone give me some guidance on how to proceed?  I need some relief.  It is making life pretty miserable.\r\nEND.",

The smell of paint fumes is nauseating and you get lightheaded. Neighbors have ask him to please make a paint booth with filters, so they dont all get sick. His reply to them, it's my land and no one can tell me what to do. Kids in the area all have breathing problems. Someone needs to go look at his place. He is also very close to the river, and the fumes travel downhill to the river. \r\nThe guy is dangerous and shoots peoples stuff, if they say anything to him. The next day or so they find bullet holes in there outdoor items. \r\nThis is a serious violation of EPA regulations. Operating a car painting/repair business with no filters in place. He works 5-6 days a week from early morning until dark pretty much every day. \r\nEnclosed is a photo of his information.

        "complaint": "Dear Karen,\r\nSeveral times a week, my home and family farm is engulfed in a plume of stinky smoke with ash particulates from the neighboring poultry farm. Needless to say, this is obviously unhealthy, does not qualify as quality air to breath, and does not meet acceptable living standards. I have talked to the DNR EPD about it before, and was informed that this form of pollution was outside the scope of authority of the EPD. I was then directed to the dept of agriculture, who informed me that they only license the incinerators, do not handle the pollution caused by the incinerators or misuse of the incinerators, and then directed me back to the EPD.\r\n\r\nWhat I am attempting to accomplish is to prevent my farm from being filled with smoke, and to preserve the quality of the natural resources within my farm and around it. Taking the poultry farm to court in order to receive compensation for damages undergone, is an extremely costly venture to undertake, will breed further hostility in this small community, and most importantly will not necessarily guarantee the safety of our farm from further exposure to toxins produced by the poultry farm. Homes that have been handed down from one generation to the next carry a large amount of personal attachment that cannot be compensated for through financial means. So, to file for suit against the poultry company, might be a necessary action, but not necessarily a productive one.\r\n\r\nWhat I am having difficulty finding out is how are huge farms of this size exempt from following pollution guidelines that only seem decent and common place for other forms of industry? More importantly, I do not know why pollution of this nature appears to be completely uninhibited from occurring, and/or why does poultry production get the proverbial \"get out of jail free\" card and other less apparent forms of pollution not? To place into context, one receives a fine for littering, yet what is occurring on my farm to my family can occur without repercussions.\r\n\r\nI know that our situation is an exception to the rule and is the result of excessiveness and not common place, but I have difficulty accepting that there is no action that can be taken to end this other than by potentially ineffective personal legal action. The EPD representative I talked with mentioned that the smoke and debris is a direct result of the farm overloading the incinerators beyond the recommended limits. This is obviously negligence, but legally can only be dealt with by seeking repayment for damages. Why is that, and is there really no agency that can put a stop to this?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Ingram",

Per the City of Savannah, this is the only action that should be occurring. However, the Marina manager, Mike, has his younger employees doing things the facility nor the employees are equipped for. Scraping, grinding, and the removal/application of anti-fouling paint are being conducted on a regular basis. We have alerted the City, but nothing has been done so far. This facility was not designed for these activities. It is not equipped with filtration or downdraft systems. When this grinding occurs, the dust (fiberglass or anti-fouling paint particles) goes everywhere. This is within feet of adjacent residential property. We can no longer even have our windows open because of this toxic dust coming in when this happens. As this anti-fouling paint contains heavy metals, it is frightening to think what might occur to nearby residents, Marina patrons, or these employees that don't know better. No respirator is used by the employees when this is going on. As the Marina is not supposed to be conducting operations like this, but still do so on a regular basis, I would hope something could be done. We don't want or need this heavy metal dust in our air or water.",

We have a business on this same property (salon); therefore, we moved into slumber and navigate other household functions. However, the fume has taken this location over. We have reached out to the insurance, state agencies, private agencies, etc. yet, no one has been able to help us rectify this matter and frankly, don\u2019t seem willing to help or care.\r\n\r\nWe are now HOMELESS but still paying a mortgage making it impossible to afford another at the moment. This is an issue that is no cause of ours whether it is architectural, soil, irrigation, industrial or other related, we have no idea. We are clueless on how to deal with this as we are not familiar with any of the possibilities, it is just not our specialty. \r\n\r\nWe are asking for IMMEDIATE help with this matter. We feel that the entire system assembled around this matter has failed us. No one, no company, no entity seems to take this seriously because it is not personal to them. Our health is at stake and we are law-abiding, tax paying, honest, hard-working individuals so it is astonishing to witness the lack of support we have received. We are in a rural area and it is can be assumed that we are not considered much when it comes to environmental safety (air quality, pollutants, industrial locations, land-fields, etc.), better health-related opportunities (sidewalks, health-food stores / markets, etc.).  \r\n\r\nWe were wondering, but now we see that the state, the government, the companies & agencies that are supposed to be in place for us, to help us, to guide us, to protect us WILL indeed allow us to die from foreign fumes / substances, be homeless (even while paying a mortgage), and never RECTIFY such a major issue (left for the next victim).

I'm writing to see if the problem of Gas Fumes can be investigated by your company.\r\n\r\nOn three (3) separate occasions, I've been overcome by gas fumes, in the last few months, when I go into my backyard or just being near the backdoor of my home, if I leave it ajar for my cats. \r\n\r\nThe air is so heavy with fumes, it seems there is no oxygen and breathing is almost impossible. My lungs immediately tightened and began to ache. I really have to struggle to get back into my house or away from the backdoor to an area in my home where it takes a while to breathe freely again. The smell reminds me of WD40.\r\n\r\nI have no idea of what this might be. I've lived here for over fifteen years and the first two episodes were in 2020 and the third one was on January 6, 2021.\r\n\r\nIn all of my years here in Cuthbert, Georgia, I've seen very few commercial airplanes fly over, but it seems they're getting more frequent. Is it possible the airlines are dumping fuel over our area before landing in Atlanta? I just don't know what to think, but it's very frightening to experience. ",

I believe GAEPD announced they had secured funding for an additional 6 months of air testing. We are so grateful that the agency continues to measure air quality, as it is our only way to ensure our community is safe. Is it the agency\u2019s intent to compare the results from Oct 2019-Mar 2020 (while the plant was not operating) to Oct 2020-Mar 2021 (while plant is operating at capacity)? I think everyone can agree there has been a noticeable increase since they reopened in April 2020. \r\n\r\nSeveral things have been observed and documented since this summer. The first concerns a trailer that was parked daily at door #16 from July 16-25. The garage door was regularly open halfway each time we observed.\r\nPlease see the attached photos.\r\n \r\nI have time/date stamped photos if you need more.\r\n\r\nThere currently is another trailer parked at dock #24 since Oct 15. Please see the picture below. Again I have time/date stamped photos if you need them.\r\n\r\nLastly, in mid-July a temporary air system was installed on the side of the building. The hoses have duct tape patches on them. The system appears to have been removed as of November 9, 2020. See pics below.\r\n\r\nThis certainly does not offer the appearance of a safe state of the art facility the company continues to tout. Quite honestly it is alarming. Please help me understand how any of this is not in violation of the permit that creates a negative pressure system on the plant. Additionally, we have witnessed multiple dock doors open at one time for large amounts of time. I recently witness a working using a grinding wheel near the dock doors. Sparks were flying from the grinder. I have video of this. Again, please explain to me how this is safe. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards ",

When the adjoining property was rezoned to Manufacturing, we were assured by our local Planning Dept. that no pollution  of any kind would be allow to affect our neighboring residential properties. Now they tell me they don\u2019t have the ability to do anything about a cabinet shop that is allowing what smells like strong paint fumes to be exhausted from their shop. At times it is so strong that we can\u2019t stay out in our backyard. Unfortunately, we are only separated by a chain link fence. We normally leave our windows open this time of the year and let our whole house attic fan cool our house. We can\u2019t even do that when a slight shift in the prevailing winds from the southwest brings those fumes right into the house.  Not only do I have to deal with the headaches I get from exposure to these fumes , but we now have out 1 year old grandson living with us and I am extremely worried about the effect that these VOC\u2019s could possibly have on his development.  Is there any way that the state can check to see if they have any sort of filter on their exhaust system and if so, is it working properly ? The Environmental Compliance folks in Columbia County tell me that they are not equipped to do air monitoring and suggested I contact the EPD. \r\nI have attached a map showing the location of the business, Cedar Ridge Cabinet Company at 321 UN Court, as it relates to my house location at 5168 Bluegrass Trail , Grovetown, Ga. 30813 \r\nI\u2019m hoping if your department is not the correct group to handle this type of problem, you can point me in the right direction of who I need to contact.\r\nI would appreciate any help that you can provide.",

Apparently this is a problem that has been going on at different times during the year for years now.  I know that it was going on 21 years ago when I moved to Cumming, however, it usually doesn\u2019t last this long and some years it is worse than others.  This year just happens to be one of the worse.  Daily it is a topic on the internet because people do not know what it is or what is going on.  The problem is the City of Cumming is apparently doing nothing to correct the problem.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get out of the way that it is not the lake and the water - that is a whole other issue which is being worked on by the utility company.  \r\n\r\nIt is Tyson or Koch, and most of the citizens know it.  Their system (that they own) located near the fairgrounds is the culprit, and it needs to be fixed.  As a resident of Cumming I should not have to put up with this because I do believe there is a solution to the problem.    If there are any type of air vents on that tank, there is probably a filtration system that would help get rid of the stench.  If in fact the problem can be fixed, Tyson needs to step up and correct it.  If they choose to ignore it the City of Cumming needs to force them to correct the problem or start enforcing a fine until it is corrected.\r\n\r\nMy house now reeks from this stench, my allegories are out of control, and I am just sick and tired of this problem going on year after year. Thank goodness my house is not on the market for sale, because there is no way anyone would want to buy property in the Cumming area. To the city, I say \u201cStep Up and Do Something, (just because I know you can)\u201d.",

This is a residential area. I shouldn't have to navigate when I go outside because this landfill gases are consuming the oxygen. Please help and send a team to investigate why this landfill is emitting unhealthy gases into air. You know these gases can cause tumors, cancer, bronchitis, mental disorders, etc. I have a right to enjoy my property 24/7. I have to navigate when to go outside unless I wear a breathing respirator-type mask just to breathe. The air is so concentrated with methane gas until it suffocates the oxygen to my brain. This is inhumane and no one should suffer at the hands of a landfill. THIS IS A HEAVILY POPULATED RESIDENTIAL AREA, for God's sake!\"",
