Atl, Ga. 30316, for the SECOND time, to open burn debris in a camp fire in his the back yard approxametly 20 feet from my back door and windows. The smoke from this fire invaded my home. I warned him head of time that I objected to this fire because smoke from the fire would harm me and that the fire was about to be lit. I pleaded with him to call his tenants and tell them NOT to light the fire. He refused and the fire was lit and smoke invaded my house. Mr. Gentin knew this would be the result because I reminded him of a previous camp fire built in the exact same spot and in the exact same manner about a year before. The fire violated City of Atlanta Fire Prevention Code in that it had absolutely no screening anywhere around it, beneath it or on top, in that it was a \"camp fire\" built directly on the ground. The camp fire was built with toxic black vinyl bricks surrounding it. These vinyl bricks appeared to be made for gardening purposes. The camp fire was within 15 feet of a few structures, a car, a deck, a large tree with over hanging branches near the fire and a fence. The fire burned unpermitted debris, I objected to the camp fire before it was lit, and smoke from the camp fire invaded my home. Since Mr. Gentin doesn't care that each time he allows an unpermitted open burn/camp fire so close to my home I suffer burning eyes, scratchy throat, chest pain and pain in my back between my shoulder blades or about the effects the smoke has on my lung disease I would like the protection of this agency to prevent any future open burns/camp fires. I feel that fines and or a court appearance would deter future episodes. I did call the police, Officer Murphy who responded, knew nothing about the fire code, took no notes or measurements, but he did make out a police report. What is in that report, I can only imagine since in contains no pertinant facts. None the less, here is the case number of the police report: 240512138L. Here is the phone number he told me to call to check if the report is ready, 404-xxx-xxxx. He said it would take 7 to 10 days before the report was available. Please help me, I have made several calls to other agencies, to no avail. Each one told me that I was calling the wrong place. I don't know who else to call to get help.

Southern Metals is a metal recycling facility but people bring them many items in addition to metals like plastics and rubber. To recover or isolate the metal from the plastic and rubber Southern Metals just puts everything in a big pile and burns it creating a toxic cloud that constantly blows downwind onto other businesses. I also frequently smell chlorine gas in the air coming from activities at Southern Metals Recycling. I understand that they may have to use some process in certain situations to separate metals from plastics/rubber...but they should be required to have some kind of capture system for the deadly fumes they are releasing into the air on a daily basis. It is just a open air pike they burn at least everyday, 5 days a week. Workers at surrounding businesses should not be subjected to this and there are neighborhoods being affects as well. I work in the area and may have to quit my job soon because I cannot jeopardize my health because Southern Metals is blatantly committing environmental violations on a daily basis affecting the air we all breath. In closing, they are just burning a toxic pile of rubber, plastic, metals literally any and every material you can imagine on a daily basis and it creates a toxic cloud that drifts onto neighboring businesses. It's admirable that they area recycling business but they need to find a better way than burning everyday. Or they need to get a contained burning apparatus, like a incinerator to capture the toxic gasses and fumes they are emitting. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please contact me if any further information is needed. I pray that someone will help put an end to this blatant environmental violation so that we may work and breath freely",

This has been going on for months as I have contacted my HOA (Waterways) and Pulte to have this road watered to no avail. This is causing breathing issues due to the massive amount of unknown partials that I am breathing daily. I am retired and work outside in my yard and continue to breath this unknown substance. This is a blatant disregard for my health/property, wife's health/property along with the other 14 homes along this dirt road - and is a direct violation. I have videos of the massive clouds of partials created by each truck up and down Belvedere Rd. Due to the size restrictions of your site I am unable to send you the videos but are available at anytime. I have added a picture as of yesterday on the grit that is generated and hangs in the air with each truck that passes Monday-Friday 8-5. It is ruining my outdoor furniture not to mention what I am breathing (picture of where I ran a cloth over a piece of plastic from one day) as I have to cover it in plastic front and back porches all week and cannot sit outside and enjoy it or grill out. I need something done ASAP and if I have contacted the wrong parties please refer me accordingly.

The smoke and smell has been and is ridiculous and I have respiratory issues on top of this. I had on the strongest mask I could locate and still couldn't deal with it. My question is regarding the time, I see where it states an hour prior to sun going down? Also regarding the fact that I have a noted medical respiratory system issue that is greatly affected by this. I would greatly appreciate any information/feedback etc.you can provide as in seeing a couple additional neighbors come outside as they were smelling it inside, it's just overall really ridiculous as it settles very low for whatever reason. \r\nThank you\r\nCourtney Smith \r\n",

        "complaint": "egregious development by TPA Residential .  I have been living adjacent to a nightmarish and non stop assault on my quality of life for 15 months  and NOW?  It's even worse and STILL no end in sight. Originally, when they publicized the plans they claimed the entire project including vertical buildings would be finished by June of '24.  They won't even be finished with the mitigation by then.  \r\nThey are taking absolutely NO care to keep the toxic dust and dirt out of the air and it is floating around the area coating everything, including my home and car.  When I approached the site manager the other day and asked instead of crushing the old concrete slabs through a grinder making horrible noise and spewing toxins into the air why don't they haul it all out and crush it in a waste disposal area,  he denied it was happening, said \"It's too expensive\" So in other words, we are creating a  high decibel, highly stressful atmosphere and spewing toxins  all over  a residential area and then  dismissed me, told me to get off the property and that he would not discuss it.  \r\nI have not been able to use my property during the day outside since August of '22 due to the noise, stench and toxic nature of the site where old homes full of asbestos and lead paint and cars and who knows what else was dumped there.  I can literally feel grit and dirt on my face if I have to go out in my yard for any reason.  And it still stinks out there at night most of the time. \r\nI probably have the worst of it, given that my property is on the corner closest to the operation with both front and back yards facing it, but it's affecting people across, along both sides of the block.  \r\nIt's become inhumane and abusive and made my lovely home a hell hole.  And TPA does not care whatsoever.  They lied from the beginning about the scope of this project to keep people from standing up against it. Either that or they are catastrophically incompetent, which is as bad.  And NOT ONE TIME, has ANYONE offered me ANY compensation for the LOSS of the use of my property, for the stress, for the dirt and dust all over my pergola, my porch, my outdoor furniture, my care. EVERY SINGLE DAY. \r\n\r\nThey sent these smiling young representatives over in the early summer of 2020\r\n\r\nto show us all the wonderful plans for the location and said NOTHING about the mitigation, although I knew from a neighbor that there would be some.  And when they did get it started and it was evident that this was really bad, they lied about how long it would go on. John Jensen, The project manager said to my face that it would be completed no later than March of '23, which in October of '22 when he said it, sounded horrible. 5 more MONTHS of this?!!! That's a dream now. \r\n\r\nThis disgusting glossing over of it that everyone's values will increase because of it while they are destroying our rights to some quality of life for YEARS, is no comfort.  I would GLADLY give that up to have avoided this monstrous and corrupt profiteering at the expense of the surrounding community.  \r\nHere are some photos and videos to support that they are unleashing toxic dust all over everyone. Enjoy the rattling, roaring, banging, clanging, beeping.  The windshield is my car the day after I washed it. That's what it's like almost every day.\r\nIMAGINE LIVING WITH THIS 6 DAYS A WEEK ALL DAY FOR 2 YEARS.  THEN IT WILL BE AT LEAST  ANOTHER 1.5 YEARS OF VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION.  WHO APPROVED THIS?",

The only problem with that is our community, Brookshire Retreat, was subjected to ashes covering cars and roofs along with air quality issues.

The dust from the birds (from their feed/bird feces) that the fans throw into the air, happens several times throughout each day.

The bird pens back up to the federally protected wetlands and the urine from the birds, dust from the birds when it rains, all runs off into the wetlands. I am concerned for that as well as the disposal of any deceased birds. Mr. Baxter did have an inspection from the state (Complaint Case Number: 89694338742) but told Robert Veal (state inspector # 260564) that he was not selling birds to the public so the property was not inspected for commercial sales.",

We noticed an unusual shape of the cloud over our home in Milledgeville GA and found that there's a massive cloud of hazardous air pollution coming out of Sparks, GA. Ive attached images of the phenomenon we noticed on the AQI radar map. A cursory search of plants in the Sparks area shows that there's a large BASF chemical plant there. We don't know what's producing the toxic cloud, but it's apparent that an emitter in Sparks is the culprit. Can someone investigate?",

A large portion of this production supplies the drying operation which consists of 6 million board feet of air drying yard with T sheds and 600 thousand board feet of kiln capacity. Buena vista is also home to the Oakcrest hardwood flooring operation. This state of the art facility produces more than 16 million square feet annually.\r\nIn 2005 and 2006 the company expanded the dry kiln capacity in Buena Vista, Georgia and built the unfinished flooring operation. \r\nThey were permitted in September 2004.\r\nThe following suggests they might have added more boiler capacity. They also added a wood flooring facility across the street: http://www.millerpublishing.com/FullFeatureStory.asp?ID=107&Publication=3\r\n\r\nWith current enforcement for other lumber mills, and their expansions without permits, I suggest they be added to someone's inspection list.\r\n",

His fire pit is between a fence and his garage.  The smoke comes over the fence into our backyard, onto our deck and if we have any windows or doors open, into our house.  Both my wife & myself have asked him to move his fire pit farther away from our house since both my wife and myself have breathing issues associated with allergies and age.  my wife talked to him today about moving his fire pit where the smoke does not bother\r\nus.   His response was that we bother him and he was not moving his fire\r\npit.\r\n\r\nIn the past, my wife talked to the fire dept.  They said he could claim that the fire pit was for cooking food and had to be where it is.  They told us to call the Johns Creek police every time he burns and after a record of calls existed they'd come and do something so the fire pit was unusable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently it is Sept which is a No Burn Month.   He burns at night which\r\nis not permitted and dangerous.\r\n\r\nHe is not suppose to burn without his neighbors approval.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease advise me on how to handle this matter since it is not only\r\neffecting our physical health but emotional well being.

I strongly suspect it is coming from Environmental Remedies and their industrial treatment facility, since it's a chemical smell. As you can see below, I also reached out to Environmental Remedies directly. If you Google the business (I hope this link works), you will see some negative \"reviews\" by other neighbors because of the air quality issues they've been causing.\r\n\r\nI understand they provide an important service, but it does not seem that an active industrial wastewater treatment plant belongs in a residential area with ever-increasing density. I hope there's a way that this issue can be addressed. My neighbors and I really appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSarah White\r\n",

        "complaint": "Follow up to above referenced complaint: CTS 102802\r\nIt is now several months since this initial complaint and as I suspected, the business is now once again exhausting fumes that have a very strong odor and are causing me to be nauseous in my own yard and home.  I would ask that you send a different investigator who will actually perform a thorough investigation on these toxic fumes. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe following is a draft of an email that I composed, but never sent with the hopeful expectation this matter was resolved. Clearly, it is not:\r\n\r\n    I would invite each of you to review the complaint, and the subsequent report/investigation of my complaint. It was my hope that you would find no toxic chemicals and put at ease my mind and concerns over what I and my neighbors are inhaling. \r\nAfter reviewing the report online, I spoke with Mr. Mark Peake this morning in regards to his investigation and report. Unfortunately, this did very little to ease my concerns. \r\n\r\nAs stated in the report and confirmed in our conversation this morning, he did no actual monitoring or testing of the emissions from the building. The fan was not running. Fumes were not being exhausted. He did not specify, approve or audit the source of the emissions.\r\n He did not physically inspect the chemicals being used. He conducted a cursory tour of the property and subsequently allowed the owners to self report on the amounts and types of chemicals being used. \r\nIn addition, he allowed them to self report on the data sheets and provide them to him in a delayed response a week or two later.\r\n In my opinion, this was little more than a telephone interview could have accomplished, not a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nAnd as of today, miraculously, the fan is once again running, and exhausting fumes, which have absolutely no odor at all.  Imagine that!\r\nI am certainly pleased to report that I am not inhaling nauseous fumes. However, I do not consider this matter closed, and I am highly concerned that it will continue once the owners believe they are no longer being monitored. \r\nIn addition, Mr. Peake found it necessary to reprimand me when I inquired as to a valid permit for this business. He stated the owners are not required to have a permit for any air quality emissions and the business was allowed there long before this residential neighborhood was built. I would invite him or you to verify those comments. My home was built in the 1930s. This neighborhood was platted and developed before that time and I know for a fact that business has not been operational for 90 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nI submitted a simple request to my government agency after speaking with the owner multiple times over the course of 5 years about the condition of the property, and he refused with a sly grin to participate in any type of voluntary cleanup.\r\n I have even suggested that a baffle be placed on the building to direct those fumes up rather than directly into my residence.\r\n I\u2019m not asking for his livelihood to be affected. I\u2019m asking for a simple, commonsense remedy so that we can all live without toxic air in our homes.\r\n",

Let me begin by saying that THE CLEAN AIR ACT protects health and welfare from different types of air pollution.  This mill is already not following the act and with growth and additions, it will comply even less.  Our property is approximately 300 yards from this saw mill and we deal with the air pollution daily!  There are many problems that already affect us daily with existing mill without the approval of additions that you seem to want to approve.  The noise level is already unbearable at most times and it has taken away all of our peace and tranquility.  We can not enjoy being at home for all the NOISE!  At the same time, we are dealing with fallout from the mill such as smoke/smog settling down on us and constant sour smells.  There is a loud humming noise from the pellet mill that has increased as well.  Also this year, we have an additional problem of wood chips (sawdust) falling on our property, particularly our vehicles.  They have been covered with this fallout and I have advised a lawyer in Swainsboro along with pictures as documentation.  Our car detailer has told us that this residue will damage the paint on our vehicles!!  Keep in mind that we are breathing all this stuff into our lungs and God only knows what it is doing to our health and breathing.  We have valid concerns already with existing problems, this expansion will add to the levels of gases and different chemicals being released into the air and providing even greater damage to our health.  I know that you state this will be monitored, but I think these reports should be published and mailed to neighbors of the mill.\r\n\r\nI also believe that a public hearing should be conducted to address the issues that are current and any issues the expansion may cause.  The method and frequency of monitoring should be discussed and any questions should be answered at this time.  The notice of public comment was hidden in our local paper in the middle of legal ads.  It should have been on a page in bold print so it was easily seen and should have been broadcast on our local radio station.  In addition, a personal letter should have been sent out to landowners within a 5-mile radius.  I strongly feel that I have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed.  It is my understanding that laws, rules and any government decisions should be fair to ALL people, not just one group pr entity.\r\n\r\nMs. Kirby has spoken with Richard MacNeely, a local lawyer in Swainsboro who represents Faircloth Forest Products, and has expressed her concerns to him several times. \r\n",

        "complaint": "We have a serious situation in Midtown with a construction site emitting large amounts of white plastic pellets from sanding of their high-rise insulation. It is blanketing the neighborhood, floating in the air, ending in pools, etc. The situation is awful. Please provide emergency intervention for this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks much for your help.\r\n\r\nThe building in question is the Toll Brothers (Balfour) Momentum Midtown towers between Spring and West Peachtree, at 1018 W. Peachtree St. NW, Atlanta, GA 30309 (https://www.momentummidtown.com).\r\n\r\nThe white pellets from them sanding their building insulation without any protection are overwhelming the neighborhood. We have a lot of construction around us, but it has never reached a point where we cannot use the Aqua Condominium pool which is actually hidden from the construction by our building, but yet is filled with white pellets.\r\n\r\nThis is the building in question. It is the same building that had the collapsed crane. You can see the white Styrofoam insulation being applied and being sanded down generating showers of white particles in a half mile radius.\r\n\r\nCan you please help us by activating the appropriate enforcement unit of the city. We cannot have our pool disabled for the entire summer because of the careless construction practices of Balfour.\r\n\r\nThis is the worse construction pollution I have seen here in Midtown since 2017.\r\n\r\nThe construction is bringing with it challenges as we know, and I want to raise the issue of the amount of flying debris and small plastic particles coming from these construction sites.\r\n\r\nIn particular the building right across from us (the one where the crane lost its ballast recently) is being covered by a white plastic isolation material (Styrofoam or something similar) which after installation is sanded in a process which sends a rain of very little while pellets in a radius of probably a half a mile. Our building swimming pool which is actually on the back of Aqua has a large quantity of these pellets floating. This is concerning because of the amount of dirt generated in Midtown, but also because as we know these debris do not just disappear, they create a long lasting pollution and contribute to the awful microplastic pollution of our water systems and oceans.\r\n\r\nMy question to you is what can be done to force construction companies to reduce the amount of dust generated?

Today it was burning my eyes I wonder the people wanted to Margaritaville salesman was commenting that he got a dizzy spell because of something in the air. And I heard very people as I walked around some of them were coughing and some of them might have had some cold or something but there's times I've walked by there and it was welding going on I could tell because I could welding smoke that was in the air she couldn't see burn my eyes. You need to go over there and investigate you need to test the air around that 40 theater on upper level near the stingray touch bowl. There's something in the air and it's not good and it's toxic when it burns your eyes and when it makes people call and when it may just friend of mine said he had a dizzy spell that means it spread throughout the building I know it is for a fact because it down the downstairs atrium one more and it was all around there and it was really strong and unbearable and everybody I talked to was complaining about it. So you can investigate this or you can let it be in a lot of people tourist employees involunteers will be suffering from the toxicity of the air.

On top of an excessively high rate of methamphetamine usage and distribution, the city itself endorses the release of toxins in the air at night during summers to repel mosquitos from my understanding. As I was not the home owner I cant be 100%, but do not believe any of the residence were given mass forms or any sort of public knowledge or warning of the risks to health that the toxins being sprayed into the air might have on ones health. I personally can speak of my experience that when these toxins were released, my body when in to an anaphylactic type state and my throat began swelling shut on multiple occasions. It began causing extreme anxiety and almost a fear of going outside during the evenings. Also have on-site of where possible illegal dumping of chemicals is occurring that maybe making their way back into the drinking water. I have witnesses that can testify to this and pics which I will attach. I would prefer to keep my name anonymous as this town is know to shut people up without anyone knowing about it or letting other ms take the fall. I feel the release of my name would put my life at risk. As the selections for emergency required me to dial 911, due to my lack of faith and knowing first hand what 911 in Berrien county can cause, I opted not to do so.

This morning it's more like a strong cleaning detergent and it is mildly affecting my skin.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I was looking for direction as to where to go from here. I looked into renting equipment that could identify these smells, but, since it's impossible to identify where the smells are coming from I wouldn't know what to do once they're identified.  When I found a couple of companies that rent the equipment, but the language is way over my head.\r\n\r\nI have been in contact with a mold company that says they have the equipment, but my concern is that they would rip me off by insisting on pursuing mold remediation.

I cannot perfectly describe the smell, but it reminds me of a surfer or rotten egg smell.  I have particularly noticed it around my home beginning a year or two ago (maybe longer), sometimes late night and mostly early morning.  The odor has become more prominent and more of a regular thing over the past several months or more.  I used to only notice it when I go outside of my house, but now it seeps indoors.  That is what I wake up to many mornings - that foul smell.  I step outside and there it is, but stronger.  It makes me nauseous.  I can\u2019t even sit on my screened porch and enjoy myself.  I am not sure where it is coming from, but I am very concerned with how this may impact my health, as well as my joy.  I have lived in my home for over 23 years now, and have only noticed this in the more recent year or two as a constant thin in the mornings more often than not.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, I lived in another area in Ellenwood that is in Dekalb County, where it was guaranteed daily either morning and/or evening to night that the odor would appear.  I complained then to no end and no satisfaction.  I suspected it was coming from a land field near I-285 on the East side near the 675 and Bouldercrest exits. Now years later and in another area, I am experiencing it again.\r\n\r\nI would like to get more information on: \r\n1.\tWhat the odor is, \r\n2.\tWhere it is coming from, \r\n3.\tWhat is the impact to health of residents, \r\n4.\tWhat can be done to eliminate it, and \r\n5.\tWho within the state and/or county is responsible for addressing this concern.\r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate a response.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDeborah Williams\r\n770-xxx-xxxx\r\n[email@removed.invalid]\r\n",

The Smell can be smelt all over East Dublin, Eastern Laurens County in the city and the county parts and sometimes as far as into Dublin.  It has particularly gotten worse over the past year and now is emitted on a daily basis. The air quality is so bad you can not open your windows or door nor sit outside without being overwhelmed with the disgusting smell, which sometimes will turn your stomach and about make you vomit it's so terrible. \r\nAt one point several years ago a lawsuit was brought against them and they were made to add a chemical to whatever it is they up there cooking/manufacturing, which would eliminate the odors. But after the New owners Darling took over they do not use the product and just pollute our air, it also keeps new businesses from coming to our area, and homeowners sell. It is ashamed you cannot sit outside in your yard or drive down the road towards town without being subject to this poor air quality. \r\nPlease respond with any information to help with this problem.

I cannot perfectly describe the smell, but it reminds me of a surfer or rotten egg smell.  I have particularly noticed it around my home beginning a year or two ago (maybe longer), sometimes late night and mostly early morning.  The odor has become more prominent and more of a regular thing over the past several months or more.  I used to only notice it when I go outside of my house, but now it seeps indoors.  That is what I wake up to many mornings - that foul smell.  I step outside and there it is, but stronger.  It makes me nauseous.  I can\u2019t even sit on my screened porch and enjoy myself.  I am not sure where it is coming from, but I am very concerned with how this may impact my health, as well as my joy.  I have lived in my home for over 23 years now, and have only noticed this in the more recent year or two as a constant thin in the mornings more often than not.\r\n \r\nMany years ago, I lived in another area in Ellenwood that is in Dekalb County, where it was guaranteed daily either morning and/or evening to night that the odor would appear.  I complained then to no end and no satisfaction.  I suspected it was coming from a land field near I-285 on the East side near the 675 and Bouldercrest exits. Now years later and in another area, I am experiencing it again.\r\n \r\nI would like to get more information on: \r\nWhat the odor is, \r\nWhere it is coming from, \r\nWhat is the impact to health of residents, \r\nWhat can be done to eliminate it, and \r\nWho within the state and/or county is responsible for addressing this concern.\r\n \r\nI would very much appreciate a response.",

I found him as a point of contact, off the EPA website. It stated that there was private funded programs to allow citizens to utilize particulate matter testing for their area. I am requesting support to do this and requesting the EPA test the Meadowcreek high school property and adjacent neighborhoods in Norcross, Georgia. The site sits adjacent to the extremely large Vulcan quarry that has over 85 violations in multiple states across the country for high Particulate Matter output from Quarry operations. These operations can add to asthma and cancer levels and should immediately be tested on the Meadowcreek High School property. The Vulcan property has been only feet from Meadowcreek for almost 30 years and as far as I know,  has NEVER been tested for particulate matter levels in the air or pollution levels in the water that passes underneath the quarry and dumps into a small residential lake, while multiple athletic fields only feet from the site expose young athletes to potentially cancer causing high particulate matter only feet from Vulcan property. There are two High Schools one public, Meadowcreek HS, one private, Atlanta Christian, within one mile of the massive quarry. Can the EPA finally air quality test in this area for a 12 month period? How can a citizen request this Federal agency to finally test the silica level in the water directly across the street in the water downstream of this area? Too long this  location and placement of this high school has been unaddressed and its potential danger to student athletes and resident in the low income area? Please Advise.",

More specifically, Satilla Church Road Baxley, GA 31513.  \r\n\r\nThere is a highly concerning level of smoke that has flooded the neighborhood during these past few days. I have seen that the smoke is a product from land clearing. \r\n\r\nI am not wanting to make a fuss over land clearing, as it usually causes no interferences or any other issues, but this is affecting a whole community. \r\n\r\nThe smoke is so heavy and thick, that one can not even see any of the road when attempting their daily commute. It is suffocating to just walk outside, even as a healthy young adult. My one year old already has an major impact on his breathing due to the smoke pollution. I can barely see my driveway during the day. I have soot and black ashes in my nose, just from breathing the air in my yard. \r\n\r\nLocal authorities stopped traffic yesterday morning for a couple hours, due to the volume of the smoke and concern for safety. \r\n This was a major inconvenience to myself and anyone else who is on a timed schedule. Students are tardy, due to no fault of their own, yet still punished as such. Same as regular employees, or anyone with a scheduled appointment. \r\n\r\nIt seems to be an overexcessive, rushed, and hasty land clearing.

Below is the narrative from the caller's email:\r\n\r\n\"Once again, the Ogeecheeton-Dawes Community has been hit with another wrong in our neighborhood. As you are aware, Savannah Auto Export continues to disregard their denial of being granted a permit to operate as a business. Just a few hours ago I witnessed them operating as though this was just another workday. I was able to contact the city and they immediately sent someone who issued them a SECOND citation. For the record, that citation will not stop them from operating. What's it going to take for them to adhere to the rules and regulations of the city government? \r\n \r\nIf that's not enough, we just witnessed our community signage as you enter the neighborhood being demolished to the ground. It took us a long time to get that sign for which the city purchased. We were not notified of this activity and neither did the city have knowledge of what took place. This is not right! I am reluctant to say this, but could it be that.............................\"You fill in the blanks\". \r\n \r\nFor many, many years, Ogeecheeton has been overlooked and placed on the backburner when it came to funding anything in our community. The pavilion was long coming on the playground, and we are grateful.  However, whatever was placed over the sand is mushy and sinks in as you walk through the park. We recently received a portable potty on the outside of the park because we don't have a community center like our sister neighboring communities. Something we've been asking for as long as I can remember.\r\n \r\nMany in our community have died while several others are sick and dealing with respiratory issues due to the environmental problems caused by Clarkes Block which sits at our back door. We have been vocal of our concerns for nearly twenty years to no avail. That's a long time and unacceptable to us.   \r\n \r\nOther residents in Savannah tend to use Ogeecheeton as a dumping ground for their unwanted trash and waste items such as tires, furniture, lawn trash, etc. Our location, in what has been called the bottom makes for an easy hideaway or throwaway. \r\n \r\nAll of the above demonstrates that our community does not matter, but we were here long before many of the other communities. We are a group of citizens who are extremely displeased and dissatisfied with the way we have been treated.       \r\n \r\nJohnnie Mae Law\"\r\n",

One truck spilled waste leaving from the Vienna plant and down I-75 to Cordele before they were aware of the spill. Absolutely in need of an environmental impact inspection/review. I hope that the actions taken in response to this report are in the best interest of the inhabitants of the surrounding area.\"",

Apparently, the self-reporting responsibility and the Walton County monitoring responsibility isn\u2019t working to well.  We have reports from residents and passersby of huge dust clouds, causing breathing problems, eye irritation, dirt and dust within homes and on vehicles, filthy swimming pools.  One person contacted me and said the horses at a horse farm on 278, adjacent to the project, were grazing in one of these dust clouds.  This has all come from the huge clouds of dirt, dust, dried grass and hay that is in the air.  Apparently they have equipment scraping the ground, loading the earth into dump trucks and hauling it to one spot elsewhere on the property where it is being dumped.  (When we get the rain that is predicted for next week there will be a huge mud pile)\r\n\r\nPlease address this problem this morning or today and/or tell us what else to do.

        "complaint": "Dear Mr. Williams,  \r\n\r\nI\u2019m contacting you in regulars to the fact there is ongoing grading in rural Rutledge Georgia as of this week billowing tons of red dust into the air. \r\n\r\nThere was a recent court ruling against the JDA and the State regarding a bond they were requesting for RIVIAN to be built here. The court ruled with the citizens and against the State and JDA. \r\n\r\nIn court, both the representative for the State and the JDA stated, without this bond, this project cannot go forward. \r\n\r\nWe in opposition, mainly because of the environmental issues that a 20 million sq ft MEGA Industrial Auto Plant, 7 stories high on 2003 acres in a RURAL agricultural zoned area, will cause irreparable damage to our community. \r\n\r\nThis grading, in spite of what both parties swore under oath to the judge about the bond denial \u201ckilling the deal\u201d, is a slap in the face of the court and the citizens here in opposition. \r\n\r\nWe are well dependent, this grading and the fact we are all well dependent here, is unacceptable! Water is already an issue here. My husband and I have in the past, had our own well go dry. We could not afford a drilled well so we had to pay for another dug well far from the dry well and the cost to run pipe back to our house, was as much or more than the well. \r\n\r\nOur Morgan County Comprehensive Use Plan, 2017-2036 states this land and all around it will remain agricultural through 2036. We citizens who live, work, farm, own small businesses here, are the ones who approved that plan. We depended on people, we had trusted to implement that plan through its full term and theirs, but they did not. \r\n\r\nThose on the JDA and Morgan County Board of Commissioners who were supposed to represent our area in this county, some developed their own legacy farmland (one, the former JDA chairman serving then, resigned, before he was paid a great profit, (20 times the going price per acre here) for that same legacy farmland, saying \u201cbecause it wouldn\u2019t look right if he was still chairman\u201d when his families good name and legacy farmland was sold out and paid for. (All public record) \r\n\r\nThe JDA threw this project to the state by letter overnight (again public record) when citizens were finally told RIVIAN was coming to Rutledge and it was already a \u201cDone Deal\u201d. There was no transparency! Everything done on this \u201cclosed door deal\u201d for years, had been hidden in secret, under NDAs. The first any citizen (not involved) knew about this, was when the Governor announced on TV Dec 16, 2021 that RIVIAN (the company the state had already purchased the Industrial site for, near Savannah) where they have placed Hyundai recently. Instead RIVIAN (a risky financial EV start up) would be put on our legacy farmland zoned Agricultural, being actively farmed (the last hay was just cut recently).  \r\n\r\nAfter the project was thrown to the state by the JDA, stating by letter \u201cthis project (they developed) is too big for us to handle, the Gov took it over for the State, the next day. \r\n\r\nThe rezoning meeting, our ONE chance to express our environmental and other concerns, was cancelled! And the rezoning from agricultural until 2036, now for heavy industrial use by the State, the sign came down. \r\n\r\nWe in Rutledge, with Hard Labor Creek State Park and UGA\u2019s Observatory placed here intentionally, because of lack of light pollution, will no longer be able to operate and use their brand new telescope. \r\n\r\nCamp Twin Lakes where I volunteer in summers as \u201cnurse Pam\u201d for our special needs children, is in sight of this area. It like the Observatory, was placed here for a reason. Clean air and clean well water. The twin lakes the special children fish in and row in, not to mention the peace and quiet a camp like this needs, will all be taken away. \r\n\r\nOur abundant wild life including the American Bald Eagle that soars overhead after making a comeback here, will all be in danger! The barn swallow nests are abundant here. They build every year on my front porch and in barns and at houses all around. Deer are plentiful here along with many other species. Squirrels, including black fox squirrels, birds of ever color, we have it all! For now. The Georgia Audubon Society was already aware of RIVIAN early on in this process and we\u2019re concerned about it\u2019s impact here.\r\n\r\nPlease, I beg you, if there is anything the State EPD and/or DNR can do to help us here and save our legacy farmland and wildlife habitat, it will be most appreciated. The DNR building and fish hatchery are in this same area of the proposed plant, on Hwy 278 in neighboring Walton Co. We never had a voice, because there was no transparency here and we didn\u2019t know anything of the magnitude of this plant, heading our way. Please be our voice now! \r\n\r\nI have a picture of the Bald Eagle in a tree on Centennial Road, taken recently by my husband\u2019s cousin. A road with no exit or entrance now, about to be changed. It\u2019s exit\u2019s and entrances will feed onto a five lane access Road, running adjacent to I 20. \r\n\r\nI have concerns about all these things and more. I have concerns about where all this displaced wildlife will go. I have concerns about our special kids at Camp Twin Lakes who just returned this year after missing two years of eligibility to this camp, because of the Pandemic. \r\n\r\nThat is their only time they are away from home, at no charge to their parents. A magical place where all their outdoor dreams can come true! A chance to spend a week with other children like themselves out of doors, with nature and do what other more able bodied children take for granted at summer camps. One on one ratio camper to counselor, volunteer nurses, firefighters, EMTS make this possible, along with our sponsors. \r\n\r\nDuring the past two years, with generous donations from sponsors, Camp Twin Lakes has doubled its size! Prepared to open the new section soon and serve twice as many special needs children as ever before. We celebrated our 30th year with MDA Camp there in July of this year. Please don\u2019t let it be our children's last! They have fragile conditions such as muscular dystrophy, diabetes, cancer, skin disease and so much more. They can\u2019t be exposed to contaminants in air and water, or the noise and light pollution. \r\n\r\nWhen we Rutledge citizens finally found out on TV RIVIAN was coming, we started attending as many JDA meetings as we could, trying to have an opportunity to express ALL our many concerns. \r\n\r\nAt one of those many meetings we attended early on, the JDAs own expert admitted our water table, the loss of multiple ponds on this land as well as our three best natural streams to be covered over with dirt and buried under 2003 acres of concrete and asphalt, would all be affected. Greatest fear, our wells! The expert also said lakes and streams from here at HLC State Park, Camp Twin Lakes next door, on down to Lake Sinclair and Lake Oconee would be adversely affected. We heard him! \r\n\r\nNo EPD studies have been shown to us. One meeting for citizen input on design and EPD issues, held in Monroe, Walton Co turned out to be only a \u201cflack taker\u201d meeting. The panel had no answers for our questions and concerns. No plan or designs to even show us for input on. No EPD studies had been done and no permits had been applied for. \r\n\r\nIt seems once the State of Georgia took over the project, our legacy farmland, the need for normal ways for citizens to have any input, checks and balances here on zoning and other issues, were all taken away. \r\n\r\nAfter our prescient setting win in court denying the bond came down, it now seems nothing has changed! With the drought we are experiencing no consideration for us in that. Grading was to start on this past Monday, and it did! The dust is rolling, smell of pine sap is in the air, the noise pollution has begun along with the destruction and the erasure of 2003 of the most beautiful \u201ctrue green\u201d legacy farmland acres in Georgia, has begun. \r\n\r\nPlease if you can\u2019t stop this, and we\u2019ve won what both parties said would \u201ckill the deal\u201d in court. Hiring the best EPD attorney we could find, recommended to me as one of five by our national EPD when contacted. We at the late notice we finally got, after the deal was done, have done everything agencies such as yours has recommended we do, but still the State started grading on their own previously set schedule? Again, as if we citizens and the courts and agencies that regulate these things, don\u2019t exist! \r\n\r\nCan our state run completely over our rights and grade our way of life away? No matter how this was achieved and no matter what the court rules against them? \r\n\r\nWe will lose all the green, all the trees, and all the wildlife habitat along with our only sources of clean water. We need that water for our wells we are dependent on here. Our pools that weren\u2019t closed yet, already have a layer of red dust and reddened debris in the bottom. Our air is dusty red. Our hearts are broken but not our spirits. \r\n\r\nRutledge isn\u2019t known as \u201cSmall But Special\u201d as just a slogan. We are special because of our community, our people and will remain so. A town with a population less than 1000 has opposition numbers 3400 strong on our #no2rivian website and Our Communities Oppose RIVIAN Assembly Plant page, on FB. Hundreds of the community filled a giant barn recently to hear from our lawyers, just before the ruling in our favor! \r\n\r\nIf you want to see what we have, please visit these sites online or better yet, come here in person. I\u2019d be happy to show you around! \r\n\r\nMy husband and I own the oldest business in town, Rutledge Hardware Store built in1891 and has been in continuous operation since. We are the fourth owners of record. We have fought for the best for this community, for 42 years. We got Rutledge, as a town, on the National Register of Historic Places. \r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t even have a red light in town, we have a STOP barrel that the NY Times featured and called \u201cRutledge\u2019s only sophisticated traffic device\u201d. It was built by my father in law and his good friend and sanctioned by the DOT as their engineers had no solution for where to put stop signs on our corners of Main and Fairplay street. \r\n\r\nRutledge Hardware sits on Fairplay Street. We live on Fairplay Road. This one move by local officials thrown to the State puts everything we have here in jeopardy. The JDA has a new sign at the exit off I 20 onto Hwy 278 on the Rutledge side. It stands exactly where I have a photo of my husbands grandmother Cassie tending her cows in 1930, on the historic Butler Place. Nothing done here by county or State, has been \u201cFair Play\u201d.\r\n\r\nThat new sign with the JDA on it and put up by them, reads \u201cEast Atlanta MEGA Industrial Site\u201d. There could not be a more unsuitable place or contrast between Grandma Cassie standing on that spot with her Jersey cows and now the JDA planting their sign there, announcing the plans they have for us. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but to me that is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. The JDA announcing they are not finished here, they\u2019ve only just begun. There will be no evidence of the generations of farmers who still farm here today. There will be no home for the Bald Eagle and the thousands of other wildlife that is so abundant here now. No barns for the barn swallows to build  nests in. There will be no gently rolling green pastures or farms or clean water or star lit nights here for our observatory. By erasing our history, they, the JDA are erasing our agricultural heritage, ALWAYS and forever.\r\n\r\nTheir excuse, to create more jobs. We need more workers here, not more jobs! We need real green pastures to lie down in, not a risky start up EV Auto Plant! Look at help wanted signs and unemployment rates for our county and state. Where will 7500 workers come from? Where will they live? There aren\u2019t locals available for these new jobs or even enough locals needing work for the two jobs for every unemployed worker here today!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry this letter is so long and got so personal. But I\u2019m laying my broken heart bare for you. I\u2019m doing this to see if anyone in this state truly cares about the environment that exists here now and the needs of citizens and Camp Twin Lakes for special children. The Observatory, the farms and the families who exist here now. I pray you do. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nPam Jones, RN \r\nSmall business owner \r\nProtector of all things Rutledge for over 42 years   ",

A collection of dump truck loads of dirt is being amassed adjacent to the largest lake on the former Verner property.  The dirt is being scraped up from other areas of the property and moved by truck to the dumping point.  There is no silt fence between the growing dirt mountain and the lake.

Complainant stated that Steve will investigate also and complainant stated that Steve will need catch the subject of the complaint in the act of burning solid waste.\r\n\r\nComplainant stated that Roy McMillan and family at 6335 Countryland Dr, Dawsonville GA 30534 burn cardboard, dog poop, cardboard containers from take-out chicken (including frying oil from the fried chicken), styrofoam from frozen chicken packaging, plastic, empty plastic bottles of drain-o and detergent, and dog food bags.   Complainant stated that Roy McMillan's Mom is incontinent and relieves herself onto her clothes and that Roy and his Mom burn the clothes with the human waste still on the clothes and burn garden lime with the clothes.\r\n\r\nComplainant stated that the McMillan family and residents burn some of the solid waste in an old fashioned wood burning stove that is inside the covered back deck.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that they also burn using an old silver metal trash can that has holes in the bottom of it.  The trash can apparently has wheels.  This burning is done on a concrete pad that is behind the fence gate slightly uphill behind the driveway in the back yard.  When not burning, they keep this trash can in the garage with a white box over the trash can.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that they also burn in holes that they dig in their yard that they cover up by refilling with dirt when they are done burning in that hole.

The Complainand stated that the burning time for burning human waste is at night.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that their health is affected and that they suffer now from constipation and gastrointestinal problems.  Also, their dermatologist has documented chemical burns on their skin.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that they believe that the McMillans and residents are making drugs at their house because the Complainant sometimes smells a \"hospital odor\", and also the odor common in beauty salons of long ago when women would go to get perms.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that Roy McMillan calls himself \"head of the burning garbage committee.\"  The Complainant stated that they have received 45 letters without signatures or return addresses with various comments and statements about burning garbage including accusing the Complainant of burning garbage and hurting the neighbors health.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that after the McMillans and residents burn, the Complainant can't get the rubber and plastic smell out of the house for hours and hours.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that Diane McMillan poured pickle juice on the Complainant's black-eyed susan flowers at the mailbox and killed them.\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that Roy McMillan told their spouse, \"I've been burning all my life and I'm going to continue burning.\"  And, \"nobody in the government is going to do anything about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that Roy McMillan is retired but drives for Lyft.\r\n\r\nI asked the Complainant \"If I go out there today, what will I see?\"  The Complainant responded, \"I don't know, they keep the burn can in the garage with a white box over the burn can.\"\r\n\r\nThe Complainant stated that in general, they are messy people with lawn decorations and a large bird house structure on the property.\r\n\r\nSee previous complaints:\r\n94914\r\n94916\r\n95033\r\n96106",

Howorth claims to have 2 burn permits under agriculture and states that he is allowed to burn. Doug Andrews says that Mr. Howorth's property is zoned in part for agriculture and in part for residential, and that the burning is occurring on the residential side. However, Doug states that he is pretty sure that the wood waste being burned is not being cleared from the property itself, but is actually being brought in from offsite and being burned onsite. Hall County Forestry has been unable to find solid evidence on their initial investigation that this claim is true, but they are suspicious of the amount of wood waste being burned without clear evidence that land clearing is happening on site. \r\n\r\nDoug Andrews indicated that they believe Mr. Howorth is attempting this as a way for his business to get around applying for a commercial burn permit from Hall county. He stated that Hall county has strict rules on issuing burn permits with agriculture exemptions. They have not been able to find solid evidence to deny Mr. Howorth but are suspicious of his activity. \r\n\r\nFire Marshal investigator's #: 678-xxx-xxxx (investigator on duty w/ phone changes every 24 hours)\r\nFire department office #: 770-xxx-xxxx",

Please see the details of their complaints at the bottom of this email. This property first came to our attention after a complaint that was submitted to the National Response Center on November 8th, 2021. Yesterday and this morning we received complaints from three residents (Susan Lee, and Debra and Steve English both via phone and email).\r\n\r\nWhile you work to investigate this complaint, we hope that you will help provide some clarification on this situation. This property has almost continuously burned for weeks since land clearing activities began in September. What are their requirements for obtaining burn permits and are there any restrictions for the length of time that they can burn? Are their restrictions on burning during dry periods or periods with high wind? Individual property owners would not be allowed to have a perpetual fire for months on end, so why is this developer allowed to do so? Why were they not required to haul off the wood debris like is often done during land clearing practices? What firefighting equipment do they have on site to put out fires at night or when winds increase to prevent fires spreading to neighboring properties?\r\n\r\nThis property is adjacent to numerous residential properties, including a retirement home, and the newly built Altama Elementary School. When the winds increase in intensity, the perpetual smoke causes impacts to the health and quality of life of neighboring residents. In addition, the fires are causing particulate matter to accumulate on the homes and vehicles of neighboring residences (see attached photos). This particulate matter can get inside homes and cause damage to fragile respiratory systems of the residents within. \r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about this complaint. We look forward to hearing back from you with additional information regarding our questions and your investigations into this matter. \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nRachael Thompson\r\nExecutive Director\r\nGlynn Environmental Coalition\r\nOffice: (912) xxx-xxxx\r\nwww.glynnenvironmental.org\r\n________________________________________\r\nFrom: Susan Lee <[email@removed.invalid]> \r\nSent: Friday, January 7, 2022 11:12 AM\r\nTo: [email@removed.invalid]\r\nSubject: Ash on car\r\n\r\nI hope these pictures show the ash that is getting on the car daily. \r\n________________________________________\r\nFrom: Debra English <[email@removed.invalid]> \r\nSent: Thursday, January 6, 2022 11:58 PM\r\nTo: [email@removed.invalid]\r\nSubject: Re: Chapel Crossing Rd\r\n\r\nI am Steve's wife Debra English.\r\nWe are tired of being hostage to our home.  Most homeowners on this road are over 60 years old and most are retired.  How long will this burn permit allowed?\r\nThey cleared trees 09/20/21.  Burning began after deep pit dug on 09/23/2021.  The southwest warm winds have permeated our property as well as all of my neighbors!\r\nWe have been held hostage!!!  Do we have Called Wayne O'neal and no  help (our District 3 County Commissioner). and called David O'Quinn that my neighbor knows plus called the DNR and they said it was okay to burn these wetlands since they were FRESH WATER!  We should be held hostage due to these greedy people.  The Senior Living of Addison House butts up to this clearing!  They have the debris as high as 3 stories all around perimeter of the  lake and still piling it up.  It will take them months and months to burn this methane gas smoldering debris.  The fire marshall and code enforcement and fire chief have been notified.  They were rewarded this burn permit that send not ashes but gooey debris that sticks to your vehicles (wash every other day, my vehicle is covered with tarp).  \r\nNot fair to be HOSTAGE.  We have RIGHTS TOO!!!!\r\nWho can we call?  The Senator for our area Sheila NcNeill in Atlanta or The Governor?\r\nPlease advise\r\nThank you for listening and look forward to your response!\r\nThank you kindly!\r\nCordially, Debra English 912-xxx-xxxx\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nFrom: Debra English <[email@removed.invalid]> \r\nSent: Thursday, January 6, 2022 10:17 PM\r\nTo: [email@removed.invalid]\r\nSubject: Chapel Crossing Rd\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern,\r\nI'm sending this email because of health concerns. I live at 671 Chapel Crossing Rd. I have lived here for 39 years and now  across the road, they have cleared the land and are burning the dubree, which is full of methane gas. I have stage 4 melanoma in my lungs and am currently getting treatment at Mayo in Jacksonville, Fl. I cannot go outside because of the fumes from the burning.I feel like I am a prisoner in my own home. I have spoken with commissioners with no results. I'm having to go to the car wash every day to wash the ash off my vehicles. How do companies get burn permits, when it's dry and the wind is gusting 40 mph? This land is wetlands, but because it's freshwater it's OK to develop?\r\nI guess this county is more concerned about the dollar than people's health, on the mainland. I bet if this was going on, on St Simons, it would be stopped!\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nNotes from voicemail from Susan Lee on Thursday January 6, 2022 at 3:43 PM\r\n\r\nLives at 651 Chapel Crossing Road, sick and tired of smelling burning from land clearing across the street. Smoke rolls through the yard non-stop, grandchildren can\u2019t go outside. Neighbor has lung cancer he can\u2019t go outside. Burns your eyes when you go outside to check the mail, the smoke billows whichever way the wind blows. It is just awful and has been going on for at least 8 weeks, non-stop, 24/7. Let me know if there is a time limit for burning, do they have to haul off material that is not burned after a certain period of time?  They must be doing it to save money, not fair that we have to be held captive in this house. Been in the house for 38 years. There is so much more left to burn, it will continue to go until march or April. They don\u2019t put the fires out at night, it goes into our homes, into the retirement home. They shouldn\u2019t be able to burn day in and day out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are tired of being hostage to our home.  Most homeowners on this road are over 60 years old and most are retired.  How long will this burn permit allowed?\r\n\r\nThey cleared trees 09/20/21.  Burning began after deep pit dug on 09/23/2021.

I live in Ringgold GA.\r\nThe fire dept. has been called a few times and they have given him a warning, but when the City Deputy Fire Chief has been notified, he repeatedly says he's out of town and to phone 911. \r\nI'm not sure the neighborhood should be repeatedly phoning 911, when this situation is clearly illegal and should have been stopped by now. \r\n \r\nThis neighbor burns his trash, plastics, rubber, boxes and anything else. There is no fire pit or container and it's just on his grass. No-one monitors the fire, once it's lit. They just walk away and let it burn. The woods are less than 30 feet away and he typically chooses windy days for his burns. Large pieces of debris and ash fly into yards and and the toxic smoke engulfs the whole neighborhood and even comes into my home. There is no getting away from it. \r\n \r\nI know burning trash is illegal in GA due to the toxic smoke that can cause serious health issues. \r\n \r\nPlease help!! \r\n \r\nThank you for your time, consideration and help,\r\n",

        "complaint": "Dear Karen,\r\nSeveral times a week, my home and family farm is engulfed in a plume of stinky smoke with ash particulates from the neighboring poultry farm. Needless to say, this is obviously unhealthy, does not qualify as quality air to breath, and does not meet acceptable living standards. I have talked to the DNR EPD about it before, and was informed that this form of pollution was outside the scope of authority of the EPD. I was then directed to the dept of agriculture, who informed me that they only license the incinerators, do not handle the pollution caused by the incinerators or misuse of the incinerators, and then directed me back to the EPD.\r\n\r\nWhat I am attempting to accomplish is to prevent my farm from being filled with smoke, and to preserve the quality of the natural resources within my farm and around it. Taking the poultry farm to court in order to receive compensation for damages undergone, is an extremely costly venture to undertake, will breed further hostility in this small community, and most importantly will not necessarily guarantee the safety of our farm from further exposure to toxins produced by the poultry farm. Homes that have been handed down from one generation to the next carry a large amount of personal attachment that cannot be compensated for through financial means. So, to file for suit against the poultry company, might be a necessary action, but not necessarily a productive one.\r\n\r\nWhat I am having difficulty finding out is how are huge farms of this size exempt from following pollution guidelines that only seem decent and common place for other forms of industry? More importantly, I do not know why pollution of this nature appears to be completely uninhibited from occurring, and/or why does poultry production get the proverbial \"get out of jail free\" card and other less apparent forms of pollution not? To place into context, one receives a fine for littering, yet what is occurring on my farm to my family can occur without repercussions.\r\n\r\nI know that our situation is an exception to the rule and is the result of excessiveness and not common place, but I have difficulty accepting that there is no action that can be taken to end this other than by potentially ineffective personal legal action. The EPD representative I talked with mentioned that the smoke and debris is a direct result of the farm overloading the incinerators beyond the recommended limits. This is obviously negligence, but legally can only be dealt with by seeking repayment for damages. Why is that, and is there really no agency that can put a stop to this?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Ingram",

So the smoke and everything comes over on us all the time, At times they have burned pallets wrapped in plastic and tires, so I contacted the local marshall. He said they did not have a burn permit so he would instruction them to get one and also not to burn harmful items. It has been a few days and I have not seen them yet burn anything harmful again, but they do burn close to our home as well as on the ground burning logs and burning other debris in a old trash dump and leaving them over night still burning unattended. Is it ok for a commercial company to burn so close to homes? And to leave it unattended? \" - from AskEPD",

Scraping, grinding, and the removal/application of anti-fouling paint are being conducted on a regular basis. We have alerted the City, but nothing has been done so far. This facility was not designed for these activities. It is not equipped with filtration or downdraft systems. When this grinding occurs, the dust (fiberglass or anti-fouling paint particles) goes everywhere. This is within feet of adjacent residential property. We can no longer even have our windows open because of this toxic dust coming in when this happens. As this anti-fouling paint contains heavy metals, it is frightening to think what might occur to nearby residents, Marina patrons, or these employees that don't know better. No respirator is used by the employees when this is going on.

Fires erupted in 2018 and 2019 as well, and the brand new facility that was re-built after the 2015 fires crumbled yesterday evening again in the fire this year. You can see a video of the structure falling in this news report: https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2021/05/03/reports-of-a-warehouse-fire-in-brunswick/. We have heard from the local fire department that the fire hydrants on site were NOT FUNCTIONING, which was the case in the 2015 fires as well. Instead, they have had to pull water from the river to help extinguish the fires. Were the hydrants never repaired? This facility catches fire on nearly an ANNUAL BASIS, the clocking is merely ticking until someone gets hurt, on-site workers or firefighters/emergency response personnel, or homes are destroyed by the constant negligence that this company continues to showcase.

We have a business on this same property (salon); therefore, we moved into slumber and navigate other household functions. However, the fume has taken this location over. We have reached out to the insurance, state agencies, private agencies, etc. yet, no one has been able to help us rectify this matter and frankly, don\u2019t seem willing to help or care.\r\n\r\nWe are now HOMELESS but still paying a mortgage making it impossible to afford another at the moment. This is an issue that is no cause of ours whether it is architectural, soil, irrigation, industrial or other related, we have no idea. We are clueless on how to deal with this as we are not familiar with any of the possibilities, it is just not our specialty. \r\n\r\nWe are asking for IMMEDIATE help with this matter. We feel that the entire system assembled around this matter has failed us. No one, no company, no entity seems to take this seriously because it is not personal to them. Our health is at stake and we are law-abiding, tax paying, honest, hard-working individuals so it is astonishing to witness the lack of support we have received. We are in a rural area and it is can be assumed that we are not considered much when it comes to environmental safety (air quality, pollutants, industrial locations, land-fields, etc.), better health-related opportunities (sidewalks, health-food stores / markets, etc.).  \r\n\r\nWe were wondering, but now we see that the state, the government, the companies & agencies that are supposed to be in place for us, to help us, to guide us, to protect us WILL indeed allow us to die from foreign fumes / substances, be homeless (even while paying a mortgage), and never RECTIFY such a major issue (left for the next victim).

I have a scratchy throat, my eyes burn and feel crusty, and my nose is burning.\r\nI am reporting this information to you because my indoor AQI monitor has higher readings than I have ever seen, as well as my outdoor monitor. \r\nThe dryers have been especially loud the last few days and I believe they are the source of this odor.\r\nI must disagree with your department about odor simply being subjective. My monitors record levels of pm2.5 and I am concerned for my health and the health of my community.\r\n \r\nBest,\r\n \r\nGina Ward\r\n\r\nReceived another email on 3/8/21\r\n\r\nI am EXTREMELY concerned about these levels of pollution. I have never had a reading so high. \r\nLast night, I was awakened at 2:00 a.m. by the awful smell. Readings outside were at 105. Tonight, I just checked and the reading is 139 - at my neighbors it is 147. \r\n\r\nThis pollution is unacceptable and is going to literally kill my community.\r\n\r\nI would like to know what is causing the spike in readings. Is it a different fuel? Is something broken? Friday it sounded like they went off line - based on the noise we heard that they have told us in the past was steam release when they tripped.\r\n\r\nSince I began composing this email, the number has gone up to 143, now it is at 145. \r\n \r\nKaren and Estelle, please help us. Please advocate for us and protect our community.\r\n\r\nGina\r\n\r\nEmail from another complainant on 3/9:\r\n\r\nGood evening, it is 7:24 pm and we are experiencing a  very strong chemical type odor. My wife stepped out on our back porch  and practically chocked. The smell has entered our house. Last night I thought there was a diesel fuel leak somewhere, this smell lasted all night. Now it is night time again and there is a toxic like odor in the air again. Our animals are having to breath this toxic air. Please help us. What is the root cause?\r\n\r\nHi Estelle,\r\nWe did not start smelling the odor until dark, just like last night.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSeparate email on 3/9/21\r\nThis evening we are at an all time high. AQI at 163 outdoors and 80 indoors. \r\nMy throat is sore and I am experiencing problems with my eyes and nose. when the stench keeps me up it is because the numbers are up.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how GRP is compliant as I am seeing spikes in pollution. Something is wrong and you know it.\r\n\r\nThe message from David is vague, I would appreciate some clarification. Is the community in danger? Are they really going to shut down operations? Because I still smell it and feel the effects of the emissions.\r\nI can't help but think back to the residents that were poisoned for who knows how long by Colonial/Williams pipeline before anyone discovered that there was a problem. No one told residents, yet the crew to clean up the problem wore hazmat suits; the community was told not to be concerned. Please address this concern. How are we to trust those in position to protect us?\r\nI will not expand at this moment about Veolia's history of hiding the truth from communities...but it is definitely on my mind as well (think Flint River). \r\n\r\nI would like to know if I need to leave my residence to protect the health of my family. \r\n\r\nMy health issues are not a result of chicken operations, they are a result of a major polluter in my backyard. I am quite weary of the excuses. I sincerely hope that your department chooses human health over profit for private industry.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this issue,\r\n\r\nGina\r\n\r\nSeparate email on 3/9/21\r\n\r\nFor the last few nights we have been experiencing extremely heavy toxic air pollutants and chemical odors from GRP.  Sometimes it smells like diesel or fuel oil, which concentrates in our house causing our eyes and throats to burn and trouble breathing. I will ask again for the EPD to place air quality monitors around GRP with information available to EPD and the public. Our community needs help and I am asking that you help us before our health is harmed anymore. We should at least be told what we are being forced to breath. Please don't tell me it is chicken litter, I know what it smells like. I'm dreading being forced to breathe this poison another night. Thank you for any help! \r\n\r\nSeparate email on 3/10/21\r\nThe AQI inside my home this morning was 102, outside 155.\r\n\r\nI hate to tell you this, but it stinks like creosote outside, or maybe tires. I know, I know, they are not permitted to burn such things and David will say that they would never do such a thing...but mama used to say, \"if it smells like a skunk...\" \r\n\r\nMy eyes and throat are burning, my voice is shot, and I have been coughing. I have no pre-existing medical conditions and live a very healthy lifestyle. I am very concerned for my family and my community.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon. You have been wonderful about following up with me and I greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nEmail on 3/12:\r\nGood morning Estelle\r\n\r\nI was reading Cheryl\u2019s email this morning and talked with her last night. We encouraged her to send you the picture. I understand that some \u201csmoke\u201d from the stack could be water vapor effected by the cold, but this does not look like water vapor.  I\u2019m aware that the EPD has a record of the number in of shut downs and start up\u2019s at the GRP Madison Plant since operations began. Her 50 figure came from information we received from the EPD last year. If possible could you update this information for us.\r\nAs far as David Grove\u2019s tour around the plant I will add this, almost everyone being adversely affected by GRP lived here before the plant was built. We know the smell of chicken houses, litter and controlled burns they are common here. These new and dangerous odors are none of the above.\r\n\r\nEmail from Cheryl 3/12\r\nHi Estelle, I have attached 2 pictures, one is from 3:11am at my home, one taken at 6:50 am from hwy 72. The emissions from GRP blew towards my house all night. At about 7am the emissions could not be seen coming from the plant and there was no chemical air pollutants noticeable within 2 hrs. After breathing the TAP from GRP all night, my throat was burning and I could barely speak this morning. I'm sure that GRP appreciates everyone's effort in trying to find someone else to pin this pollution on, but it's very obvious that it is coming from their operation. We've been living in this same location for over 15 years and are well aware of the spring time burning, which is done during daylight hours, it has never bothered us before. The chemical pollution that  makes my house smell like a gas chamber is only at night, and only when the wind is blowing emissions from GRP or the air is still and heavy and holding the emissions around us. We know GRP is poisoning us at night, and they know as long as they do it at night that they can continue to hide it from the EPD. Are you sure that they are not burning any fuel oil? Have they told you that they are not burning any fuel oil? If GRP is in compliance, I can't understand why EPD refuses to place air quality monitors around the plant with information available to EPD and the citizens being affected. This seems to be the only way that they will be held accountable for what they burn at night. I'll ask again, can we have air quality monitors? If no, why not? We are experiencing health issues and need help. Who else do we need to reach out to? Thank you for your concern, Cheryl\r\n\r\nAdditional email 3/12\r\nHi Estelle, I know you have worked very hard and I appreciate your prompt answers. It is true that we may have gotten some smoke and smell from a fire in Oglethorpe County one day and possibly one night. However this has been going on all week. Chemical air pollutants at night when emissions were blowing our direction from GRP, no TAP after daylight, or when the wind was blowing in a different direction. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens tonight. I hope you did see my pictures where GRP  is putting out heavy smoke. Thanks again, Cheryl",

She says that her mother has had to be treated for lung problems since it's placement.  She spent five days with her mother this Christmas, and is now being treated as well as a result of having to breathe in the fibers during that time. Mrs. Lester says that she believes that toxic chemical fumes are being given off by the cotton gin, and that the health of the people living close to it is in danger. The people who own the cotton gin are saying that it will be too expensive to take down the gin because it's their livelihood - but Mrs. Lester argues that the health of the people is more important.

The emissions and drying process smell like a garbage dump. This evening and night we could see a lot of particulate matter in the air as if they were running without their filter. This seems to be a common practice to avoid using the CEMS and keep their recorded  emissions low. I still haven't been able to locate the results from their drying process that was done on May 31st or 6 mos. emissions ending in July. Could you please tell me how to get those results. Also I have not found when the comment period for water permit and air permit will be. We definitely do not want to miss those and feel we should have a community meeting before they're issued. Our health is suffering, and this is just so wrong. We need air quality monitoring equipment around the plant to keep them honest. They know EPD doesn't work at night to make a surprise visit and they are the ones who record emissions that you get. We are completely at the mercy of an uncaring and evil company. GRP management said they were shut down the first week in August, but in fact they ran the whole week with heavy emissions that smelled like 100% creosote. They probably never used filters or turned in emissions report. I can't t think of any other reason they would make the statement that they were shut down, when in fact they were burning. Now GRP is getting railcars from New Jersey with a dark very stinky biomass that we no idea what it contains and what we are breathing. They are not supposed to use c&d from a land fill, but only shipments that have been separated by best management practices. Do they keep documentation from these railcars  or just burn anything they are sent. We really should be able to find out what we are being forced to breathe. GRP  should be forced to filter their emissions at all times and filter the drying process so we don't have unmonitored VOC  and TAP. We appreciate any help you can give us. Thank you. \r\n\r\nSecond email: \r\n\r\nKaren,\r\nThere is a great deal of particulates from the plant in the air tonight. This has happened often over the past months. I believe GRP does not run their filters at night. During the day there is some smoke from their stack but at night there is a great deal more. I feel GRP is operating in this manner to evade EPD scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThird email: [email@removed.invalid]\r\n\r\nI just stopped at my mailbox and because it was dark I used my flashlight . When I turned on my flashlight I could not believe the amount of paticulate matter I saw in the air. I get to my house and see the same thing. I was under the impression that the particulate matter issue would be resolved. I would not want to breath in what I just saw. Please have this investigated.\r\n\r\nFourth email: [email@removed.invalid]\r\n\r\nDrago & I drove to the end of Ted\u2019s drive on HV Chandler Rd @ 1 AM this AM. We had just read his emailing reporting a large amount of particulate matter from the GRP plant in the air. I was able to capture a video with my iPhone as Drago held a flashlight beam. We drovearound the plant & saw PM in Air at other locations but it was much thicker in the direction of Ted\u2019s house. The plant was venting some steam at this time & the big pile of chips was \u201csmoking.\u201d \r\nI will send those photos also.\r\n\r\nFifth email (from Cheryl):\r\n\r\nI have attached 3 pictures July 31, Aug 3, and Aug 4, 2020. I had checked the Ga. EPD complaint tracking System ID 94308 and noticed that Stephanie Cahill from Northeast Dist. office had made an investigation on Sept 16th to GRP. In that report she said David Groves said GRP was shut down 3 weeks beginning July 12 thru the first week in August. I checked my calendar and had first noticed black smoke after their shutdown at 5pm July 31. they ran all week and until the middle of September with very heavy emissions. I don't think it was as important to them to produce electricity as it was to dispose of railroad ties. I believe they were making more from disposing of the ties than producing power and will be looking for other material to burn for profit. I think they run many times at night without filtering or monitoring because the emissions are so much heavier. The emissions were not as bad last night and I'm guessing it's because you made an inquiry, as the emissions were better after Stephanie Cahill's inspection.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n",

I believe GAEPD announced they had secured funding for an additional 6 months of air testing. We are so grateful that the agency continues to measure air quality, as it is our only way to ensure our community is safe. Is it the agency\u2019s intent to compare the results from Oct 2019-Mar 2020 (while the plant was not operating) to Oct 2020-Mar 2021 (while plant is operating at capacity)? I think everyone can agree there has been a noticeable increase since they reopened in April 2020. \r\n\r\nSeveral things have been observed and documented since this summer. The first concerns a trailer that was parked daily at door #16 from July 16-25. The garage door was regularly open halfway each time we observed.\r\nPlease see the attached photos.\r\n \r\nI have time/date stamped photos if you need more.\r\n\r\nThere currently is another trailer parked at dock #24 since Oct 15. Please see the picture below. Again I have time/date stamped photos if you need them.\r\n\r\nLastly, in mid-July a temporary air system was installed on the side of the building. The hoses have duct tape patches on them. The system appears to have been removed as of November 9, 2020. See pics below.\r\n\r\nThis certainly does not offer the appearance of a safe state of the art facility the company continues to tout. Quite honestly it is alarming. Please help me understand how any of this is not in violation of the permit that creates a negative pressure system on the plant. Additionally, we have witnessed multiple dock doors open at one time for large amounts of time. I recently witness a working using a grinding wheel near the dock doors. Sparks were flying from the grinder. I have video of this. Again, please explain to me how this is safe. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards ",

        "complaint": "Email received on 10/26/20:\r\n\r\nDear Karen & Pierre,\r\n\r\nDrago & I were called Friday afternoon, Oct 23 to by Tommy & Martha Roberts, 5565 Colbert Danielsville Rd, Colbert GA. They live 1.28 miles NW of GRP Madison Biomass Plant.  We drove over to their house to investigate some ash that settled all over their yard & they thought might have come from the Madison GRP Biomass Plant. We also took photos. \r\n\r\nAt approx 7:30 AM, Martha went out to her deck to sit. She noticed that there was a large quantity of ash in the air literally \"raining down\" all over their yard, vehicles, deck etc. She stated she had never seen anything like that. She was unclear how long it lasted. She said a lot of it had blown away by the time we got there (about 3:00 PM) although to my observation, there was still a lot of ash! The ash was everywhere-like covering a large country yard, decks, roof, multiple vehicles, grass, etc.\r\n\r\nI have a medical laboratory science background so I studied the ash to try to identify the content and looked at it with a magnifying glass. It was white in color, mostly very small particles, and immediately disintegrated into powder upon touch. In other words, it was very well burnt unlike the grey/black ash particles that might float away from a camp or leaf fire. The composition appeared to be plant fibers rather than plastic or such. Some had \"veins\" that resembled a leaf. In fact, upon further examination we did find a large \"leaf ash\" imprint on their vehicle. At this point I asked Martha if she had smelled leaves burning or any odor and she said there was no odor in the air at the time the ash fell. I find it unusual that someone might be burning leaves at 7:30 AM causing ash to fall in such large quantities accompanied by no odor of burning leaves. Furthermore I suppose that GRP biomass could contain leafy/fibrous material.\r\n\r\nAfter we left the Roberts house, we stopped at a few locations along roadsides and then at the GRP Plant but saw no other sign of ash. Here are more facts:\r\n1.\tExcessive emissions were photographed on Oct 20, 5:43 PM, (IMG_6073)\r\n2.\tA Tumbling Creek resident reported excessive GRP noise levels around 12:00 AM, Oct 23\r\n3.\tAsh fell all over the Roberts yard on Oct 23, approx 7:30 AM (007, 009, 012, 015)\r\n4.\tDrago asked David Groves if the ash could have come from GRP and he said he doubted it, plus the plant was shut down Friday morning, Oct 23. (If so, it must have been shut down sometime after the midnight noise was heard and prior to the 11:07 am photo when dark smoke was emitting)\r\n5.\tExcessive emissions were photographed Oct 23, 11:07 AM (IMG_1763)\r\n6.\tExcessive emissions were photographed Oct 23, 3:59 PM and excess steam was venting from the steam vent as if there was a problem. It was very loud. I measured around 75 dB while standing at the plant entrance by the water tower.\r\nI would not waste your time or mine except we find the ash an unusual occurrence, the GRP plant did not seem to be operating at a \"steady state,\" AND our trust level with the GRP plant is low. If you can shed any light on this, we would appreciate it. \r\n\r\nBy the way, Mr. Roberts is very ill, undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer (lung I think), and has to social distance in his yard in order to see his children and grandchildren. He does not need to be breathing particulate matter into his lungs. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRuth Ann Tesanovich\r\n959 Hwy 172, Colbert, GA\r\n706-xxx-xxxx\r\n",

I still can\u2019t believe this was allowed so close to homes and in an existing neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not trying to be the \u201cangry\u201d neighbor but on behalf of the several concerned families (and the house closest to everything), I thought I would reach out.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nVan Tane\r\nCell: 716-xxx-xxxx\r\n",

When the adjoining property was rezoned to Manufacturing, we were assured by our local Planning Dept. that no pollution  of any kind would be allow to affect our neighboring residential properties. Now they tell me they don\u2019t have the ability to do anything about a cabinet shop that is allowing what smells like strong paint fumes to be exhausted from their shop. At times it is so strong that we can\u2019t stay out in our backyard. Unfortunately, we are only separated by a chain link fence. We normally leave our windows open this time of the year and let our whole house attic fan cool our house. We can\u2019t even do that when a slight shift in the prevailing winds from the southwest brings those fumes right into the house.  Not only do I have to deal with the headaches I get from exposure to these fumes , but we now have out 1 year old grandson living with us and I am extremely worried about the effect that these VOC\u2019s could possibly have on his development.  Is there any way that the state can check to see if they have any sort of filter on their exhaust system and if so, is it working properly ? The Environmental Compliance folks in Columbia County tell me that they are not equipped to do air monitoring and suggested I contact the EPD. \r\nI have attached a map showing the location of the business, Cedar Ridge Cabinet Company at 321 UN Court, as it relates to my house location at 5168 Bluegrass Trail , Grovetown, Ga. 30813 \r\nI\u2019m hoping if your department is not the correct group to handle this type of problem, you can point me in the right direction of who I need to contact.\r\nI would appreciate any help that you can provide.",

The smell is the same  it was nine months to twelve months ago! Doesn\u2019t make sense that it would smell the same now since \u201cthey are not burning creosote.\u201d It was my understanding that they informed you guys back in September that they had removed all creosote from the property and you guys could come and inspect. May- September?? What to believe!?!? Also the plant has been shutting down and starting up frequently this past week! Very Loud! I am sending you a video of emissions from the plant yesterday.

Apparently this is a problem that has been going on at different times during the year for years now.  I know that it was going on 21 years ago when I moved to Cumming, however, it usually doesn\u2019t last this long and some years it is worse than others.  This year just happens to be one of the worse.  Daily it is a topic on the internet because people do not know what it is or what is going on.  The problem is the City of Cumming is apparently doing nothing to correct the problem.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get out of the way that it is not the lake and the water - that is a whole other issue which is being worked on by the utility company.  \r\n\r\nIt is Tyson or Koch, and most of the citizens know it.  Their system (that they own) located near the fairgrounds is the culprit, and it needs to be fixed.  As a resident of Cumming I should not have to put up with this because I do believe there is a solution to the problem.    If there are any type of air vents on that tank, there is probably a filtration system that would help get rid of the stench.  If in fact the problem can be fixed, Tyson needs to step up and correct it.  If they choose to ignore it the City of Cumming needs to force them to correct the problem or start enforcing a fine until it is corrected.\r\n\r\nMy house now reeks from this stench, my allegories are out of control, and I am just sick and tired of this problem going on year after year.

She has previously complained regarding visible emissions and odor and the conditions had improved, but are back to becoming a constant issue at her residence. She stated that the facility is running through the night almost every night and the odor and black smoke coming from them is very objectionable. \r\n\r\nShe also stated that her pond (private) has a sheen on the water and it appears to have an oily residue that she believes is being caused by the lack of control devices at the asphalt plant, causing the particulate matter to accumulate in her pond. She also stated that at the firehouse adjacent to the asphalt plant, they have told her their cars are covered with a black dust they believe is coming from the plant.\r\n\r\nI informed her that since the pond is private she would likely need to have a consultant look at it to determine what the issue was and to pull any water samples. I provided her with the number to UGA aquaculture for further advisement and provided her a list of pond consultants in the state of Georgia. I let her know that we could check into East Coast Asphalt to see if there were any compliance related issues that were contributing to the conditions she described.\r\n\r\nShe later sent me pictures of her pond via text message, which are attached to this complaint.",

Please help and send a team to investigate why this landfill is emitting unhealthy gases into air. You know these gases can cause tumors, cancer, bronchitis, mental disorders, etc. I have a right to enjoy my property 24/7. I have to navigate when to go outside unless I wear a breathing respirator-type mask just to breathe. The air is so concentrated with methane gas until it suffocates the oxygen to my brain. This is inhumane and no one should suffer at the hands of a landfill. THIS IS A HEAVILY POPULATED RESIDENTIAL AREA, for God's sake!\"",

I have called and talked to Ms. Rexroat. Based on what information she provided this situation has been happening for quite some time. \r\n\r\nCan you have someone from your local EPD District or Enforcement contact Ms. Rexroat?  It is my understanding our local GFC Supervisor has referred this situation to the local EPD personnel in the past. So your folks may already be familiar.\r\n\r\nShe provided me with the name of the individual who owes the property and who is most likely the person hauling in the debris and burning it. His name is Jared Fitts. She is not sure of the numerical address but says it a couple of houses from her residence.\r\n\r\nMs. Rexroat\u2019s contact information is below. A the end of her email.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and please let me know what actions occur so I can report back to our Director.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Debbie <[email@removed.invalid]>\r\nDate: April 7, 2020 at 7:33:41 AM EDT\r\nTo: [email@removed.invalid]\r\nSubject: Smoke\r\nCAUTION: *** This is an EXTERNAL email. Please exercise CAUTION. DO NOT open attachments or CLICK LINKS from unknown senders or unexpected emails.****\r\n\r\n\r\nI called my local Forestry Department about a month ago about a neighbor that is having truckloads of trees and brush brought to his property. He cuts it up and burns it. He\u2019s Been doing this for years and it\u2019s been uncomfortable but no big deal. I recently took custody of my three grandchildren one of whom has severe allergies and asthma. It\u2019s so severe that I\u2019ve had to remove all of my carpet and had an air purification system put in my home. When I made the call to the Forestry Dept. I was told they would take care of it because it\u2019s not legal for this type of operation. The burning has continued. I was told to call the fire department if he started burning again. I called the fire department Saturday. They pulled in front of my house with lights on and all. Asked if I was referring to the neighbor two houses down. Was that necessary?  Really, they couldn\u2019t see the smoke and flames?  Well, for the past two nights the neighbor is burning late at night. So now I have my 8 yr old grandson waking me up at 2:00 am telling me that he can\u2019t breathe. Obviously we\u2019re on stay at home orders so I can\u2019t pick up and leave. He was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection yesterday and we have an appointment for X-rays to test for pneumonia today. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain my concern with this particular diagnosis at a time a virus is killing thousands of people a day. Could you please give me direction on as to how I should handle this problem?  If he\u2019s burning illegally, why can\u2019t he just be shut down?\r\nThank you,\r\nDebbie Rexroat\r\n664 McClain Mountain Rd\r\nJasper, Ga 30143\r\n706-xxx-xxxx\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Sorrells\r\nChief of Forest Protection\r\nGeorgia Forestry Commission\r\n5645 Riggins Mill Road\r\nDry Branch, GA 31020\r\nOffice: 478.xxx-xxxx\r\nCell: 912.xxx-xxxx\r\n\r\n",

It was located on Emergency Road 105 (also called Jac Arts Rd) in the vicinity of the prison, House of Grace and WDXQ radio station. I made a post to the local community page asking if anyone knows if burning of demolition debris was legal and voicing my concerns for the contamination of the site, groundwater, streams, ponds and such. My specific concers, given that this burn happened upstream from a chain of ponds that includes ours, is whether our ponds will be negatively effected and if our fish are now safe to eat. I said that the risk is high given the nature of the business and if any of the A/C related chemicals were also burned. A man, Chad Lawrence, stated in all caps that no chemicals had been burned, so he knows more about the burn and seems to have a vested interest in defending what was done to burn the debris.\"",
